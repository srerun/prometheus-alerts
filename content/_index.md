# Welcome!

Welcome to the site hosting runbooks for alerts in the 
[prometheus-alerts](https://github.com/sre/prometheus-alerts) project.


## Reason

The rules have been pulled from the [awesome-prometheus-alerts](https://samber.github.io/awesome-prometheus-alerts/) project with a runbook attribute added that points to the runbooks here because
what good are those alerting rules when one don't know what to do when the alert fires?

## Goal

We aim to ship meaningful runbook for every alert provided with enough insight to help
users during incidents.  The initial set of runbooks were AI-generated from the actual rules.

## How to contribute?

If you find any issues with current runbooks, please use the `Edit this page` link at the bottom of the runbook page.

If you find any other issues, please [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/srerun/prometheus-alerts/issues/new).
