Here is a runbook for the CassandraConnectionTimeoutsTotal alert rule:

## Meaning

The CassandraConnectionTimeoutsTotal alert is triggered when the rate of Cassandra connection timeouts exceeds 5 in a 1-minute period, sustained for 2 minutes. This indicates that some connections between nodes are ending in timeouts, which can impact the performance and reliability of the Cassandra cluster.

## Impact

* Connection timeouts can lead to data inconsistencies and loss of availability
* Impacts read and write performance, leading to slower response times and errors
* Can cause cascading failures and affect overall system reliability
* May indicate underlying issues with network connectivity, Cassandra configuration, or node health

## Diagnosis

* Check Cassandra logs for errors and warnings related to connection timeouts
* Verify network connectivity between nodes using tools like `ping` and `telnet`
* Run `nodetool` commands to check node status and connection metrics
* Review Cassandra configuration files (e.g. `cassandra.yaml`) for any misconfigurations
* Check system resource utilization (e.g. CPU, memory, disk space) to rule out resource-related issues

## Mitigation

* Investigate and resolve any network issues or misconfigurations
* Tune Cassandra configuration settings to optimize connection timeouts and retries
* Implement connection pooling or load balancing to reduce the load on individual nodes
* Consider upgrading Cassandra versions or patching known issues related to connection timeouts
* Restart nodes or restart Cassandra service if necessary to clear out stuck connections
* Monitor Cassandra metrics closely to detect any recurrences of the issue and take proactive measures to prevent it.
