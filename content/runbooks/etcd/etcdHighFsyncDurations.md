# etcdHighFsyncDurations

## Meaning

This alert fires when the 99th percentile of etcd disk fsync duration is too
high for 10 minutes.

<details>
<summary>Full context</summary>

Every write request sent to etcd has to be [fsync'd][fsync] to disk by the leader node, transmitted to its peers, and fsync'd to those disks as well before etcd can tell the client that the write request succeeded (as part of the [Raft consensus algorithm][raft]). As a result of all those fsync's, etcd cares a LOT about disk latency, which this alert picks up on.

Etcd instances perform poorly on network-attached storage. Directly-attached spinning disks may work, but solid-state disks or better [are recommended][etcd-disks] for larger clusters. For very large clusters, you may even consider a [separate etcd cluster just for events][etcd-events] to reduce the write load.

</details>

## Impact

When this happens it can lead to various scenarios like leader election failure,
frequent leader elections, slow reads and writes.

## Diagnosis

This could be result of slow disk possibly due to fragmented state in etcd or
simply due to slow disk.

### Slow disk

Checking disk related metrics and dashboards should provide a more clear
picture.

#### PromQL queries used to troubleshoot

`etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket` reports the etcd disk fsync
duration, `etcd_server_leader_changes_seen_total` reports the leader changes. To
rule out a slow disk and confirm that the disk is reasonably fast, 99th
percentile of the `etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket` should be less
than 10ms. Query in metrics UI:

```promql
histogram_quantile(0.99, sum by (instance, le) (irate(etcd_disk_wal_fsync_duration_seconds_bucket{job="etcd"}[5m])))
```

## Mitigation

### Fragmented state

In the case of slow fisk or when the etcd DB size increases, we can defragment
existing etcd DB to optimize DB consumption as described in
[here][etcdDefragmentation]. Run the following command in all etcd pods.

```console
$ etcdctl defrag
```

As validation, check the endpoint status of etcd members to know the reduced
size of etcd DB. Use for this purpose the same diagnostic approaches as listed
above. More space should be available now.

here][etcdPractices].
