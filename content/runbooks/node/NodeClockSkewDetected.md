# NodeClockSkewDetected

## Meaning

Clock skew detected.

## Impact

Time is skewed on the node. This can cause issues with handling TLS as well as problems with other time-sensitive applications.

## Diagnosis

TODO

## Mitigation

Ensure time synchronization service is running.
Set proper time servers.
Esure to sync time on server start, especially when using
low power mode or hibernation.

Some resource consuming process can cause issues on given hardware,
so move it to different servers.

On physical servers check if on-board battery requires replacement.
Check for hardware errors.
Check for firmware updates.
Ensure to use newer hardware (like server mainboard and so on).
