Here is the runbook for the Prometheus alert rule `JenkinsOutdatedPlugins`:

## Meaning

This alert is triggered when there are more than 3 outdated Jenkins plugins on a single instance. The alert indicates that the Jenkins instance is not running with the latest plugins, which can lead to security vulnerabilities, compatibility issues, and feature inconsistencies.

## Impact

The impact of outdated Jenkins plugins can be significant, including:

* Security risks: Outdated plugins may contain known vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers, compromising the security of the Jenkins instance and the entire CI/CD pipeline.
* Compatibility issues: Outdated plugins may not work correctly with the latest versions of Jenkins or other plugins, leading to errors, failures, and pipeline disruptions.
* Feature inconsistencies: Outdated plugins may not provide the latest features and functionalities, which can lead to inconsistencies in the pipeline and affect the overall quality of the builds.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Jenkins instance identified in the alert label `instance`.
2. Log in to the Jenkins instance and navigate to the Plugin Manager.
3. Check the plugins that require updates and identify the ones that are critical to the pipeline.
4. Verify that the Jenkins instance has access to the Internet and can download updates.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Update the outdated plugins to the latest version.
2. restart the Jenkins instance to ensure the updated plugins are loaded correctly.
3. Verify that the plugins are updated successfully and the pipeline is running correctly.
4. Consider enabling automatic plugin updates in Jenkins to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Review and update the Jenkins instance configuration to ensure it meets the latest security and compatibility requirements.

Remember to follow the organization's change management process and testing procedures before applying any changes to the Jenkins instance.
