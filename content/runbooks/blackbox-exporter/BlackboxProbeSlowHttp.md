Here is the runbook for the Prometheus alert rule `BlackboxProbeSlowHttp`:

## Meaning

The `BlackboxProbeSlowHttp` alert is triggered when the average HTTP request duration exceeds 1 second over a 1-minute period. This alert indicates that the Blackbox exporter is experiencing slow HTTP requests, which may impact the performance and reliability of the exporter.

## Impact

The impact of this alert can be significant, as slow HTTP requests can:

* Cause delays in scraping metrics from the Blackbox exporter
* Result in incomplete or inaccurate metric data
* Increase the load on the exporter, leading to potential crashes or timeouts
* Affect the overall performance and responsiveness of the monitoring system

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the slow HTTP requests, follow these steps:

1. Check the Blackbox exporter logs for any error messages or warnings related to HTTP requests
2. Verify that the exporter is properly configured and that the HTTP requests are correctly formatted
3. Investigate network connectivity issues between the Prometheus server and the Blackbox exporter
4. Review the metric data to identify any patterns or trends that may indicate the source of the slow requests
5. Check the system resources (CPU, memory, disk space) of the exporter to ensure it is not under heavy load

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of slow HTTP requests, follow these steps:

1. Optimize the Blackbox exporter configuration to reduce the request latency
2. Implement caching or other optimization techniques to reduce the load on the exporter
3. Increase the resources (CPU, memory, disk space) available to the exporter to handle increased loads
4. Consider distributing the load across multiple exporters or instances
5. Review and adjust the Prometheus scrape interval and timeout settings to accommodate slower request times.
