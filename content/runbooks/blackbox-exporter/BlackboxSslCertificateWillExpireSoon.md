## Meaning

The BlackboxSslCertificateWillExpireSoon alert is triggered when the SSL certificate of a monitored service is about to expire within the next 20 days. This alert is generated by the Blackbox Exporter, which is a Prometheus probe that checks the SSL certificate expiration date of a target service.

## Impact

If the SSL certificate expires, it can lead to:

* Disruption of secure communication with the service
* Errors and warnings in client applications
* Potential security risks due to the use of an expired certificate
* Downtime and revenue loss for critical services

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected service: Check the `instance` label in the alert to determine which service is affected.
2. Verify the certificate expiration date: Use the Blackbox Exporter or other SSL auditing tools to verify the expiration date of the SSL certificate.
3. Check certificate renewal process: Review the certificate renewal process to ensure it is functioning correctly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Renew the SSL certificate: Obtain a new SSL certificate from a trusted certificate authority and install it on the affected service.
2. Update the certificate configuration: Update the service configuration to use the new SSL certificate.
3. Verify the certificate: Use the Blackbox Exporter or other SSL auditing tools to verify that the new certificate is correctly installed and configured.
4. Update the certificate renewal process: Review and update the certificate renewal process to prevent similar issues in the future.
