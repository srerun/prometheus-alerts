# E5-120-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmCutoffEnable 

Alarm cutoff is activated. 



## Meaning

The `sysAlarmCutoffEnable` SNMP trap is generated when the alarm cutoff feature is activated on a network device. This feature is designed to prevent an overload of alarm notifications during a major network failure or maintenance event. When activated, the alarm cutoff feature suppresses the generation of additional alarm notifications for a specified period, allowing network administrators to focus on resolving the root cause of the issue rather than being inundated with multiple alarm notifications.

## Impact

The impact of this trap being generated is that the network device will temporarily suppress alarm notifications, which can lead to delayed or missed notifications of critical network events. This can result in prolonged network downtime, reduced network visibility, and increased mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to resolve (MTTR) for network issues.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the `sysAlarmCutoffEnable` trap, follow these steps:

1. Review the network device's configuration to determine why the alarm cutoff feature was activated.
2. Check the device's event logs to identify the specific alarm or event that triggered the alarm cutoff feature.
3. Verify that the alarm cutoff feature is set to expire after a specified period or can be manually disabled.
4. Investigate the root cause of the underlying network issue that triggered the alarm cutoff feature.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of the `sysAlarmCutoffEnable` trap, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and resolve the underlying network issue that triggered the alarm cutoff feature.
2. Disable the alarm cutoff feature once the underlying issue is resolved.
3. Configure the network device to provide a notification when the alarm cutoff feature is activated, ensuring that network administrators are aware of the situation.
4. Review and adjust the alarm cutoff feature's configuration to minimize its impact on network visibility and troubleshooting.
5. Implement a comprehensive network monitoring and notification system to minimize the risk of delayed or missed notifications of critical network events.
