# NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyRestart 

An indication that the agent has been restarted.
	 This does not imply anything about whether the configuration has
	 changed or not (unlike the standard coldStart or warmStart traps) 



## Meaning

The `NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyRestart` SNMP trap indicates that the SNMP agent has been restarted. This trap is different from the standard `coldStart` or `warmStart` traps, as it does not provide any information about whether the configuration has changed or not.

## Impact

The impact of receiving this trap is that the network monitoring system or management application may need to re-synchronize with the SNMP agent to ensure that it has the most up-to-date configuration and state information. This trap does not indicate any critical issues or errors, but rather a notification that the agent has been restarted.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the system logs to determine why the SNMP agent was restarted.
2. Verify that the SNMP agent is running and responding to requests.
3. Check the configuration of the SNMP agent to ensure it is consistent with the expected state.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Re-synchronize the network monitoring system or management application with the SNMP agent to ensure it has the most up-to-date configuration and state information.
2. Verify that the SNMP agent is configured correctly and that all necessary configuration files are in place.
3. Consider implementing a process to automatically re-synchronize with the SNMP agent after a restart, to minimize the impact on network monitoring and management.
