# NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyStart 

An indication that the agent has started running. 



## Meaning

The `NET-SNMP-AGENT-MIB::nsNotifyStart` SNMP trap indicates that the SNMP agent has started running on a device. This trap is sent by the agent to notify the network management system (NMS) that it is operational and ready to receive requests.

## Impact

The impact of receiving this trap is typically minimal, as it is an informational message indicating that the agent is running. However, it can be useful in monitoring and troubleshooting scenarios:

* Verification of agent configuration: Receiving this trap confirms that the agent is properly configured and running, which can be useful during initial setup or after configuration changes.
* Monitoring agent uptime: This trap can be used to track the uptime and availability of the agent, allowing for quick detection of any issues that may cause the agent to restart or become unavailable.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Verify agent configuration: Check the device's SNMP configuration to ensure that the agent is properly configured and enabled.
2. Check system logs: Review system logs to ensure that there are no errors or issues related to the SNMP agent.
3. Verify network connectivity: Ensure that the device has network connectivity and can communicate with the NMS.

## Mitigation

No mitigation is required for this trap, as it is an informational message indicating that the agent is running. However, it is essential to:

1. Monitor agent uptime: Regularly track the uptime and availability of the agent to quickly detect any issues that may cause the agent to restart or become unavailable.
2. Implement SNMP monitoring: Configure the NMS to monitor the device and receive traps, allowing for timely notification of any issues that may arise.
3. Perform regular maintenance: Regularly review system logs and perform maintenance tasks to ensure the agent remains operational and configured correctly.
