# E5-110-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable 

Alarm clear is activated. 



Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `E5-110-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable`:

## Meaning

The `E5-110-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable` trap indicates that the alarm clear function has been activated. This means that any active alarms on the system have been cleared, and the system is now in a normal operating state.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that any previously reported alarms are no longer active, and the system is now operating without any known issues. This could potentially affect monitoring tools and alerting systems, as they may no longer receive notifications about the cleared alarms.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the system logs to determine when the alarm clear function was activated.
2. Review the alarm history to identify which alarms were cleared.
3. Verify that the system is operating normally and that no new alarms have been triggered.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Update monitoring tools and alerting systems to reflect the cleared alarm state.
2. Verify that the system is operating within normal parameters and that no new issues have arisen.
3. Consider implementing a process to notify stakeholders of cleared alarms, to ensure that everyone is aware of the system's current state.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your system is properly monitored and maintained, even after alarms have been cleared.
