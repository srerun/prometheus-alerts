# E5-110-TRAPS-MIB::sysMacAntiSpoofing 

MAC Anti-spoofing. 


## Variables


  - sysMacAntiSpoofOrig
  - sysMacAntiSpoofNew
  - sysMacAntiSpoofMAC 

### Definitions 


**sysMacAntiSpoofOrig** 
: The Original port of Mac-AntiSpoofing. 

**sysMacAntiSpoofNew** 
: The New port of Mac-AntiSpoofing. 

**sysMacAntiSpoofMAC** 
: The MAC of Mac-AntiSpoofing. 


## Meaning

The SNMP trap E5-110-TRAPS-MIB::sysMacAntiSpoofing indicates that a MAC anti-spoofing event has occurred on the system. This trap is generated when a device connected to the system attempts to spoof a MAC address that is already registered on a different port.

## Impact

The impact of this event can be significant, as it may indicate a security threat or unauthorized device connection. If left unchecked, this could lead to unauthorized access to the network, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, the following steps can be taken:

* Check the syslog or system logs for any additional information related to the trap.
* Verify the identity of the device connected to the system and ensure it is authorized to be on the network.
* Check the MAC addresses involved (sysMacAntiSpoofOrig, sysMacAntiSpoofNew, and sysMacAntiSpoofMAC) to determine the source and target of the spoofing attempt.
* Review network access control lists (ACLs) and other security configurations to ensure they are up-to-date and effective.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, the following steps can be taken:

* Block the offending device from accessing the network until its identity can be verified and authorized.
* Update network ACLs and security configurations to prevent similar spoofing attempts in the future.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as MAC address whitelisting or blacklisting, to enhance network security.
* Alert the network security team and perform a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the event and prevent future occurrences.
