# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempClear 

Temperature error release. 


## Variables


  - ifIndex
  - voipPhoneState 

### Definitions 


**ifIndex** 
: A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
the entity's network management system to the next re-
initialization. 

**voipPhoneState** 
: Phone status of the line. 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempClear`:

## Meaning

The `E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempClear` trap indicates that a temperature error has been cleared on a VoIP phone. This trap is generated when a previously reported temperature error has been resolved, and the phone is now operating within normal temperature ranges.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as it indicates that a previously reported error has been resolved. However, it is still important to monitor the phone's temperature to ensure that it remains within normal operating ranges to prevent future errors.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of the temperature error, follow these steps:

1. Check the phone's environmental conditions to ensure that it is operating in a cool, dry location.
2. Verify that the phone is properly ventilated to prevent overheating.
3. Review system logs to determine when the temperature error occurred and if there were any other errors or issues reported around the same time.
4. Check the phone's configuration to ensure that it is properly configured and that all firmware and software are up to date.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of future temperature errors, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the phone is installed in a location that is within the recommended environmental specifications.
2. Implement regular cleaning and maintenance schedules to keep the phone free from dust and debris that can contribute to overheating.
3. Monitor system logs and temperature readings to quickly identify and respond to any future temperature errors.
4. Consider implementing redundancy or failover configurations to minimize the impact of a temperature error on VoIP services.

Note: The variables `ifIndex` and `voipPhoneState` can be used to further investigate the issue and identify the specific interface and phone state that triggered the trap.
