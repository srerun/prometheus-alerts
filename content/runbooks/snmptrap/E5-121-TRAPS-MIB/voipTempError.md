# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempError 

Temperature error trigger. 


## Variables


  - ifIndex
  - voipPhoneState 

### Definitions 


**ifIndex** 
: A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
the entity's network management system to the next re-
initialization. 

**voipPhoneState** 
: Phone status of the line. 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempError trap indicates that a temperature error has been detected on a VoIP phone. This trap is triggered when the phone's temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating a potential hardware issue.

## Impact

A temperature error on a VoIP phone can lead to:

* Phone malfunction or failure
* Disruption of voice services
* Potential damage to the phone's internal components

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Retrieve the ifIndex value from the trap to identify the affected interface.
2. Check the voipPhoneState to determine the current status of the phone.
3. Verify the temperature reading on the phone to confirm the error.
4. Review system logs and environmental monitoring systems to determine if there are any other temperature-related issues in the vicinity.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately shut down the affected VoIP phone to prevent further damage.
2. Move the phone to a cooler location or provide additional cooling measures to reduce the temperature.
3. Contact the hardware vendor or a qualified technician to repair or replace the phone.
4. Monitor the temperature readings and phone status to ensure the issue is resolved.
5. Consider implementing environmental monitoring and temperature threshold alerts to prevent similar issues in the future.
