# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::sysLoginFailure 

User login is failed. 



Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning
The `E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::sysLoginFailure` trap indicates that a user has attempted to log in to the system, but the attempt has failed. This could be due to an incorrect username, password, or other authentication issue.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that a legitimate user may be prevented from accessing the system, or an unauthorized user may be attempting to gain access to the system. In either case, it is important to investigate the cause of the login failure to ensure the security and integrity of the system.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the cause of the login failure, perform the following steps:

* Check the system logs to determine the username and IP address associated with the login attempt.
* Verify that the username and password are correct and match the expected credentials.
* Check for any issues with account lockout policies or password expiration.
* Investigate for any signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the effects of the login failure, perform the following steps:

* If the login attempt was legitimate, assist the user in resolving the issue (e.g. resetting their password).
* If the login attempt was unauthorized, notify the security team and take steps to prevent future attempts (e.g. blocking the IP address).
* Review system logs and security policies to ensure they are up-to-date and effective.
* Consider implementing additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication or intrusion detection systems, to prevent future login failures.
