Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description "E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipBatteryClear Battery fault release":

## Meaning

The "voipBatteryClear" trap indicates that a battery fault has been cleared on a VoIP device. This trap is generated when the battery fault is resolved, and normal operation is restored.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as it indicates that a previously reported battery fault has been resolved. However, it is still important to investigate the root cause of the original fault to prevent it from happening again in the future.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of the original battery fault, follow these steps:

1. Check the device logs for any error messages related to the battery fault.
2. Verify the battery type and Device ID (voipDevId) to ensure they are correct.
3. Check the battery status on the VoIP device to ensure it is functioning correctly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of future battery faults, take the following steps:

1. Ensure regular maintenance and inspection of the VoIP device and its battery.
2. Update firmware and software on the VoIP device to the latest versions.
3. Consider replacing the battery if it is old or has been previously faulty.
4. Verify that the battery type (voipBatType) is correct for the device.

Note: The voipDevId and voipBatType variables can be used to identify the specific device and battery type affected by the fault, allowing for targeted maintenance and troubleshooting.
