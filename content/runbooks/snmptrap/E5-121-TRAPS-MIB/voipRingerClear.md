# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipRingerClear 

Ringer fault release. 


## Variables


  - voipCount 

### Definitions 


**voipCount** 
: The number of ringer fault 


## Meaning

The SNMP trap E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipRingerClear indicates that a ringer fault has been cleared. This trap is generated when a previously reported ringer fault has been resolved, and the ringer is now functioning properly.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is relatively low, as it indicates that a fault has been cleared and the system is returning to a normal operating state. However, it is important to note that if the ringer fault was causing issues with voice services, the clearance of the fault may indicate that voice services are now available again.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of the ringer fault and ensure that it does not recur, the following steps can be taken:

* Review system logs to determine the root cause of the ringer fault
* Verify that all voice services are functioning properly
* Check the status of the ringer and ensure that it is operational
* Review the value of the `voipCount` variable to determine the number of ringer faults that have occurred

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of future ringer faults, the following steps can be taken:

* Implement proactive monitoring of voice services to quickly identify any issues
* Configure automated alerts for ringer faults to ensure prompt notification
* Perform regular maintenance on the voice system to prevent faults from occurring
* Develop a plan to quickly respond to ringer faults and restore voice services in the event of an outage
