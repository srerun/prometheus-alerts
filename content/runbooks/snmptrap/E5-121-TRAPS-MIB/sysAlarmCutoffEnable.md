# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmCutoffEnable 

Alarm cutoff is activated. 



Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The `E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmCutoffEnable` trap indicates that the alarm cutoff feature has been activated on the device. This feature is typically used to temporarily silence or suppress alarms and notifications for a specific period of time or until the issue is resolved.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that all alarms and notifications will be suppressed or silenced, which may lead to delayed issue detection and resolution. This can result in prolonged network downtime, reduced service quality, and potential revenue loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of this trap, perform the following steps:

1. **Verify alarm cutoff configuration**: Check the device configuration to confirm that alarm cutoff is indeed enabled and understand the reason behind its activation.
2. **Check system logs**: Review system logs for any error messages or events that may have triggered the alarm cutoff feature.
3. **Perform a system health check**: Run diagnostic tests to identify any underlying system issues that may have contributed to the alarm cutoff activation.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, follow these steps:

1. **Disable alarm cutoff**: Immediately disable the alarm cutoff feature to allow alarms and notifications to function normally.
2. **Investigate and resolve underlying issues**: Identify and resolve the root cause of the issue that triggered the alarm cutoff feature.
3. **Restart affected services**: Restart any services or processes that may have been impacted by the alarm cutoff feature.
4. **Verify system stability**: monitor the system for a period of time to ensure that it is stable and functioning normally before considering the issue resolved.
