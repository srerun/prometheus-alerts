# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipClockClear 

Clock fault release. 


## Variables


  - voipDevId 

### Definitions 


**voipDevId** 
: The device ID of the DUT. 0 means port 1 to 24. 


## Meaning

The SNMP trap "E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::voipClockClear" indicates that a clock fault has been released on a VoIP device. This trap is generated when the device has recovered from a clock fault condition, and normal operation has been restored.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as it indicates that a previous clock fault condition has been resolved. However, if the clock fault was causing issues with voice quality or call connectivity, this trap may indicate that those issues have been resolved. It's essential to monitor the device for any further clock faults or other issues that may affect voice services.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the clock fault, follow these steps:

1. Verify the device ID (voipDevId) associated with the trap to identify the specific device experiencing the clock fault.
2. Review the device's logs to determine the cause of the original clock fault.
3. Check the device's configuration and ensure that it is set up correctly for clock synchronization.
4. Verify that the device is receiving a valid clock signal from its reference source.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of a clock fault, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the device is configured to use a redundant clock source, if available.
2. Implement clock synchronization monitoring to quickly detect any future clock faults.
3. Schedule regular maintenance checks to verify the device's clock configuration and ensure it is functioning correctly.
4. Consider implementing redundancy in the VoIP infrastructure to minimize the impact of clock faults on voice services.

Note: The specific steps for mitigation may vary depending on the device model, firmware version, and network architecture. It's essential to consult the device's documentation and seek guidance from the manufacturer's support team, if necessary.
