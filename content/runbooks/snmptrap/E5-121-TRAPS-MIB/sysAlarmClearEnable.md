# E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable 

Alarm clear is activated. 



Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The "E5-121-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable" trap indicates that the alarm clear feature has been activated on the system. This means that all active alarms on the system will be automatically cleared, and the system will return to a normal operating state.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that all active alarms on the system will be cleared, which may affect ongoing troubleshooting or monitoring efforts. Additionally, if the alarms were indicating a legitimate system issue, the clearing of the alarms may mask the underlying problem, potentially leading to further system instability or downtime.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, the following steps can be taken:

* Review system logs to determine why the alarm clear feature was activated
* Check system configuration to ensure that the alarm clear feature was intentionally enabled
* Verify that there are no underlying system issues that should be causing alarms to be triggered
* Check with system administrators to see if they intentionally cleared the alarms

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, the following steps can be taken:

* Immediately verify system status to ensure that there are no underlying issues that require attention
* Review system logs and configuration to ensure that the alarm clear feature was intentionally enabled
* Consider temporarily disabling the alarm clear feature to allow for proper troubleshooting and monitoring of system issues
* Consider implementing additional monitoring or logging to detect and alert on system issues that may have been masked by the alarm clear feature.
