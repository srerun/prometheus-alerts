# E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipBatteryFail 

Battery fault trigger. 


## Variables


  - voipDevId
  - voipBatType 

### Definitions 


**voipDevId** 
: The device ID of the DUT. 0 means port 25 to 48, 1 means port 1 to 24. 

**voipBatType** 
: The number of ringer fault 


Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap "E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipBatteryFail":

## Meaning

This SNMP trap indicates that a battery fault has been triggered on a VoIP device. The battery fault may be related to a ringer fault, which could affect the device's ability to operate normally.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the VoIP device may not be able to function properly, leading to disrupted communication services. This could result in lost productivity, missed calls, and revenue loss. Additionally, if the fault is not addressed, it could lead to further damage to the device or other components, resulting in additional costs and downtime.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected VoIP device using the `voipDevId` variable, which indicates the device ID of the DUT (Device Under Test). A value of 0 indicates port 25 to 48, while a value of 1 indicates port 1 to 24.
2. Determine the type of battery fault using the `voipBatType` variable, which specifies the number of ringer faults.
3. Check the device's power supply and battery health to identify the root cause of the fault.
4. Review system logs and monitoring data to see if there are any other related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Replace the faulty battery or power supply unit to restore normal operation of the VoIP device.
2. Perform a diagnostic test on the device to ensure that the fault has been resolved and the device is functioning correctly.
3. Update the device's firmware or software to the latest version to ensure that any known issues related to battery faults are addressed.
4. Implement proactive monitoring and maintenance to identify and address potential battery faults before they occur. This may include regular battery health checks and replacement of batteries that are approaching end-of-life.
