# E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempClear 

Temperature error release. 


## Variables


  - ifIndex
  - voipPhoneState 

### Definitions 


**ifIndex** 
: A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
the entity's network management system to the next re-
initialization. 

**voipPhoneState** 
: Phone status of the line. 


## Meaning

The SNMP trap "E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipTempClear" indicates that a temperature error has been released or cleared on a VoIP phone device.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the VoIP phone device has returned to a normal operating state after experiencing a temperature error. This means that the phone is no longer at risk of overheating or experiencing temperature-related issues. However, it's essential to investigate the cause of the temperature error to prevent future occurrences.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the temperature error, follow these steps:

1. Check the phone's environment to ensure it is operating in a suitable temperature range.
2. Verify that the phone's ventilation system is functioning correctly.
3. Review the phone's event logs to identify any patterns or correlations with the temperature error.
4. Check the phone's firmware and software versions to ensure they are up-to-date.
5. Use the `ifIndex` variable to identify the specific interface related to the temperature error.
6. Check the `voipPhoneState` variable to determine the current status of the phone.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the risk of future temperature errors, follow these steps:

1. Ensure the phone is operated in a well-ventilated area, away from direct sunlight and heat sources.
2. Regularly clean the phone's ventilation system to prevent dust buildup.
3. Implement a regular firmware and software update schedule to ensure the phone has the latest features and bug fixes.
4. Monitor the phone's temperature and system logs regularly to identify potential issues before they become critical.
5. Consider implementing a temperature monitoring system to provide early warnings of potential temperature-related issues.
6. Update the phone's configuration to include temperature-related thresholds and alerts to notify administrators of potential issues.
