# E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::sysMacAntiSpoofing 

MAC Anti-spoofing. 


## Variables


  - sysMacAntiSpoofOrig
  - sysMacAntiSpoofNew
  - sysMacAntiSpoofMAC 

### Definitions 


**sysMacAntiSpoofOrig** 
: The Original port of Mac-AntiSpoofing. 

**sysMacAntiSpoofNew** 
: The New port of Mac-AntiSpoofing. 

**sysMacAntiSpoofMAC** 
: The MAC of Mac-AntiSpoofing. 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::sysMacAntiSpoofing trap indicates that the MAC anti-spoofing feature has detected a potential security threat. MAC anti-spoofing is a security feature that prevents unauthorized devices from spoofing the MAC addresses of legitimate devices on the network.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the network may be vulnerable to a security attack. If an unauthorized device is able to spoof the MAC address of a legitimate device, it may be able to access restricted areas of the network or steal sensitive information. This could lead to a security breach and potentially result in financial loss, damage to reputation, or other negative consequences.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the values of the variables associated with the trap:
	* sysMacAntiSpoofOrig: The original port of MAC anti-spoofing.
	* sysMacAntiSpoofNew: The new port of MAC anti-spoofing.
	* sysMacAntiSpoofMAC: The MAC address of the device that triggered the trap.
2. Verify that the MAC address of the device that triggered the trap is authorized to be on the network.
3. Check the network logs for any suspicious activity.
4. Investigate the physical location of the device that triggered the trap to ensure it is not a rogue device.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Block traffic from the MAC address that triggered the trap until the issue is resolved.
2. Verify that the MAC anti-spoofing feature is enabled on all devices on the network.
3. Implement additional security measures, such as access control lists (ACLs) or intrusion detection systems (IDS), to prevent unauthorized access to the network.
4. Consider implementing a network access control (NAC) system to ensure that only authorized devices are able to connect to the network.
5. Perform a thorough security audit to identify and address any vulnerabilities in the network.
