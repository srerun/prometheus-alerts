# E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipDcPowerClear 

DC power error release. 


## Variables


  - ifIndex
  - voipPhoneState 

### Definitions 


**ifIndex** 
: A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
the entity's network management system to the next re-
initialization. 

**voipPhoneState** 
: Phone status of the line. 


Here is the runbook for the SNMP trap E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipDcPowerClear:

## Meaning

The E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipDcPowerClear trap indicates that a DC power error has been released or cleared on a VoIP device. This trap is generated when the device detects that the DC power issue has been resolved, and normal operation can resume.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as it indicates that a previous power error has been cleared. However, it's essential to investigate the root cause of the original power error to prevent future occurrences, which could lead to service disruptions or outages.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of the original power error, follow these steps:

1. Check the device's system logs for any errors or warnings related to the power system.
2. Verify the power supply and cabling to ensure they are functioning correctly.
3. Check the environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, to ensure they are within the device's operating specifications.
4. Review the device's configuration and settings to ensure that they are correct and up-to-date.
5. Poll the VoIP phone's status using the `voipPhoneState` variable to determine if the phone is operational.

## Mitigation

To mitigate future power errors, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the device's power supply is redundant and functioning correctly.
2. Ensure that the device is receiving clean power and that the power cables are securely connected.
3. Monitor the device's environmental conditions and take corrective action if they exceed the recommended specifications.
4. Regularly review and update the device's configuration and settings to ensure they are correct and up-to-date.
5. Implement a monitoring system to detect potential power errors before they affect service.

Note: The `ifIndex` variable can be used to identify the specific interface related to the power error, which can aid in troubleshooting and mitigation.
