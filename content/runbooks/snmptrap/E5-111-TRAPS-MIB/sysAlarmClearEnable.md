# E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable 

Alarm clear is activated. 



## Meaning

The `E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::sysAlarmClearEnable` SNMP trap indicates that the alarm clear function has been activated. This means that the device has been configured to automatically clear alarms when a certain condition is met, such as when the underlying issue is resolved.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific device and network configuration. In general, the activation of alarm clear functionality can have both positive and negative effects:

* Positive impact: Automatic alarm clearing can help reduce noise and clutter in the network monitoring system, making it easier for administrators to focus on critical issues.
* Negative impact: If not properly configured, automatic alarm clearing can lead to missed alerts and delayed response to critical issues, potentially resulting in extended downtime or security breaches.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the device configuration: Review the device configuration to ensure that the alarm clear function is enabled and properly configured.
2. Verify alarm status: Check the alarm status to confirm that the alarm has been cleared and the underlying issue is resolved.
3. Review system logs: Analyze system logs to identify the trigger event that caused the alarm clear function to activate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the potential impact of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Review and adjust alarm clear configuration: Verify that the alarm clear function is properly configured and adjust the settings as needed to ensure that critical alarms are not cleared prematurely.
2. Implement alarm escalation procedures: Establish procedures for escalating cleared alarms to ensure that administrators are notified and can investigate the root cause of the issue.
3. Continuously monitor system logs: Regularly review system logs to identify potential issues and take proactive measures to prevent future alarm clear events.
