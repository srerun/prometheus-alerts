# E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipBatteryClear 

Battery fault release. 


## Variables


  - voipDevId
  - voipBatType 

### Definitions 


**voipDevId** 
: The device ID of the DUT. 0 means port 25 to 48, 1 means port 1 to 24. 

**voipBatType** 
: The number of ringer fault 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `E5-111-TRAPS-MIB::voipBatteryClear`:

## Meaning

This trap indicates that a battery fault has been cleared on a VoIP device. The fault may have been related to the ringer battery or other components.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as the fault has been cleared and normal operation has resumed. However, it is still important to investigate the root cause of the original fault to prevent it from happening again in the future.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected VoIP device using the `voipDevId` variable.
2. Check the `voipBatType` variable to determine the type of battery fault that occurred.
3. Review system logs to determine the cause of the fault and when it occurred.
4. Verify that the fault has been cleared and normal operation has resumed.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of future battery faults, follow these steps:

1. Schedule regular maintenance checks on VoIP devices to identify and address potential issues before they become faults.
2. Implement redundancy or backup systems to ensure continued operation in the event of a fault.
3. Consider upgrading or replacing devices with a history of battery faults to improve overall system reliability.
4. Monitor system logs and SNMP traps regularly to quickly identify and respond to any faults that do occur.
