# DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteEventSetFailure 

Notification that an attempt to do a set in response to an
event has failed.
The network manager must enable this notification only with
a certain fear and trembling, as it can easily crowd out more
important information.  It should be used only to help diagnose
a problem that has appeared in the error counters and can not
be found otherwise. 


## Variables


  - mteHotTrigger
  - mteHotTargetName
  - mteHotContextName
  - mteHotOID
  - mteFailedReason 

### Definitions 


**mteHotTrigger** 
: The name of the trigger causing the notification. 

**mteHotTargetName** 
: The SNMP Target MIB's snmpTargetAddrName related to the
notification. 

**mteHotContextName** 
: The context name related to the notification.  This MUST be as
fully-qualified as possible, including filling in wildcard
information determined in processing. 

**mteHotOID** 
: The object identifier of the destination object related to the
notification.  This MUST be as fully-qualified as possible,
including filling in wildcard information determined in
processing.
For a trigger-related notification this is from
mteTriggerValueID.
For a set failure this is from mteEventSetObject. 

**mteFailedReason** 
: The reason for the failure of an attempt to check for a
trigger condition or set an object in response to an event. 


## Meaning

The DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteEventSetFailure SNMP trap indicates that an attempt to perform a set operation in response to an event has failed. This trap is not enabled by default and should only be used to diagnose issues that cannot be identified through error counters.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is informational, providing insight into set operation failures in response to events. If not properly configured, this trap can generate a high volume of notifications, potentially overwhelming the network manager and obscuring more critical information.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, examine the following variables:

* **mteHotTrigger**: Identify the trigger that caused the notification.
* **mteHotTargetName**: Determine the SNMP Target MIB's snmpTargetAddrName related to the notification.
* **mteHotContextName**: Identify the context name related to the notification, ensuring it is fully qualified and includes wildcard information.
* **mteHotOID**: Determine the object identifier of the destination object related to the notification, ensuring it is fully qualified and includes wildcard information.
* **mteFailedReason**: Identify the reason for the failure of the set operation.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the trigger configuration is correct and functioning as intended.
2. Check the snmpTargetAddrName and context name for accuracy and ensure they are fully qualified.
3. Investigate the reason for the set operation failure (mteFailedReason) and take corrective action.
4. Review the event and trigger configuration to ensure it is properly set up and not causing unnecessary notifications.
5. Consider disabling this trap if it is not providing valuable diagnostic information, to prevent overwhelming the network manager with non-critical notifications.
