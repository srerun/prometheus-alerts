# DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteTriggerFailure 

Notification that an attempt to check a trigger has failed.
The network manager must enable this notification only with
a certain fear and trembling, as it can easily crowd out more
important information.  It should be used only to help diagnose
a problem that has appeared in the error counters and can not
be found otherwise. 


## Variables


  - mteHotTrigger
  - mteHotTargetName
  - mteHotContextName
  - mteHotOID
  - mteFailedReason 

### Definitions 


**mteHotTrigger** 
: The name of the trigger causing the notification. 

**mteHotTargetName** 
: The SNMP Target MIB's snmpTargetAddrName related to the
notification. 

**mteHotContextName** 
: The context name related to the notification.  This MUST be as
fully-qualified as possible, including filling in wildcard
information determined in processing. 

**mteHotOID** 
: The object identifier of the destination object related to the
notification.  This MUST be as fully-qualified as possible,
including filling in wildcard information determined in
processing.
For a trigger-related notification this is from
mteTriggerValueID.
For a set failure this is from mteEventSetObject. 

**mteFailedReason** 
: The reason for the failure of an attempt to check for a
trigger condition or set an object in response to an event. 


## Meaning

The DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteTriggerFailure SNMP trap indicates that an attempt to check a trigger has failed. This notification should be enabled with caution, as it can generate a high volume of alerts and potentially overwhelm more critical information. Its primary purpose is to aid in diagnosing issues that are reflected in error counters but cannot be identified through other means.

## Impact

The failure of a trigger check can have various implications, including:

* Inability to detect and respond to critical events in a timely manner
* Increased latency or errors in event-driven processes
* Potential for undetected issues to escalate and cause more severe problems
* Overwhelming of the monitoring system with excessive notifications, leading to information overload and decreased situational awareness

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, gather the following information from the SNMP trap:

* mteHotTrigger: The name of the trigger that failed
* mteHotTargetName: The SNMP target address related to the notification
* mteHotContextName: The context name associated with the notification
* mteHotOID: The object identifier of the destination object related to the notification
* mteFailedReason: The reason for the failure of the trigger check

Use this information to identify the specific trigger, target, and context involved in the failure. Consult the device logs and configuration to determine the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify and address the root cause**: Based on the diagnosis, take corrective action to resolve the underlying issue that led to the trigger check failure.
2. **Verify trigger configuration**: Review the trigger configuration to ensure it is correct and functioning as intended.
3. **Optimize trigger settings**: Adjust trigger settings to reduce the frequency of false positives or unnecessary checks.
4. **Implement rate limiting or filtering**: Configure the monitoring system to rate-limit or filter excessive notifications to prevent information overload.
5. **Monitor and review**: Continuously monitor the system and review log data to ensure the issue is resolved and to identify potential future problems.
