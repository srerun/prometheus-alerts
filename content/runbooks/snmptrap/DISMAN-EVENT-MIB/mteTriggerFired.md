# DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteTriggerFired 

Notification that the trigger indicated by the object
instances has fired, for triggers with mteTriggerType
'boolean' or 'existence'. 


## Variables


  - mteHotTrigger
  - mteHotTargetName
  - mteHotContextName
  - mteHotOID
  - mteHotValue 

### Definitions 


**mteHotTrigger** 
: The name of the trigger causing the notification. 

**mteHotTargetName** 
: The SNMP Target MIB's snmpTargetAddrName related to the
notification. 

**mteHotContextName** 
: The context name related to the notification.  This MUST be as
fully-qualified as possible, including filling in wildcard
information determined in processing. 

**mteHotOID** 
: The object identifier of the destination object related to the
notification.  This MUST be as fully-qualified as possible,
including filling in wildcard information determined in
processing.
For a trigger-related notification this is from
mteTriggerValueID.
For a set failure this is from mteEventSetObject. 

**mteHotValue** 
: The value of the object at mteTriggerValueID when a
trigger fired. 


Here is a runbook for the DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteTriggerFired SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The DISMAN-EVENT-MIB::mteTriggerFired trap indicates that a trigger has fired, which means a specific condition or event has occurred. The trigger is configured to monitor a particular object or set of objects, and when the specified condition is met, the trap is sent.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific trigger that has fired and the context in which it was configured. However, in general, this trap is an indication that something unusual or noteworthy has occurred, and it may require attention from network administrators or operators.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the `mteHotTrigger` variable to determine the name of the trigger that fired.
2. Review the `mteHotTargetName` variable to identify the SNMP target associated with the notification.
3. Examine the `mteHotContextName` variable to determine the context in which the trigger fired.
4. Inspect the `mteHotOID` variable to identify the specific object or objects being monitored.
5. Check the `mteHotValue` variable to determine the value of the object when the trigger fired.

By analyzing these variables, you should be able to determine the cause of the trigger firing and take appropriate action.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the trigger firing and take corrective action if necessary.
2. Review the trigger configuration to ensure it is operating as intended.
3. Verify that the monitored object or objects are within expected ranges or conditions.
4. Consider adjusting the trigger configuration or threshold values to prevent false positives or unnecessary notifications.
5. Inform relevant stakeholders of the trigger firing and any corrective actions taken.
