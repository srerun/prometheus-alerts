# NETELASTIC-FLEXBNG-ALARM::natExtTrapTotalSessRateUpExceedThreshold 

The trap indicates that total sessions rate up warning threshold. 


## Variables


  - natRuleName 

### Definitions 


**natRuleName** 
: The current notify rule name.
Used by vrrpExtTrapPortsExceedThreshold trap. 


## Meaning

The SNMP trap "natExtTrapTotalSessRateUpExceedThreshold" indicates that the total sessions rate has exceeded the warning threshold. This trap is generated by the NetElastic FlexBNG system, which is a broadband network gateway that provides network address translation (NAT) functionality. The trap suggests that the NAT system is experiencing a high volume of sessions, which may impact network performance and resource utilization.

## Impact

The impact of this trap may include:

* Network congestion and performance degradation due to the high volume of sessions
* Increased risk of resource exhaustion, potentially leading to service disruptions or outages
* Inability to accommodate new sessions, resulting in connection failures or rejections
* Potential security risks if the high session volume is caused by malicious activity

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of this trap, the following steps can be taken:

* Check the current session rate and compare it to the warning threshold to determine the severity of the issue
* Analyze network traffic patterns to identify any unusual or malicious activity
* Review system logs to identify any errors or warnings related to NAT functionality
* Verify that the NAT system is configured correctly and that there are no hardware or software issues
* Check for any recent changes to the network or NAT configuration that may have contributed to the issue

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, the following actions can be taken:

* Adjust the warning threshold to a more suitable value based on the network's normal operating conditions
* Implement traffic shaping or rate limiting policies to reduce the volume of sessions
* Add additional resources (e.g., RAM, CPU) to the NAT system to improve performance and capacity
* Implement security measures to prevent malicious activity from contributing to the high session volume
* Consider upgrading the NAT system or its underlying infrastructure to improve performance and scalability

Note: The natRuleName variable is not directly related to this trap, as it is used by a different trap (vrrpExtTrapPortsExceedThreshold).
