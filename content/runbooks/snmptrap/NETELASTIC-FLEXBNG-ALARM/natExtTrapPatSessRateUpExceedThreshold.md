# NETELASTIC-FLEXBNG-ALARM::natExtTrapPatSessRateUpExceedThreshold 

The trap indicates that PAT sessions rate up warning threshold. 


## Variables


  - natRuleName 

### Definitions 


**natRuleName** 
: The current notify rule name.
Used by vrrpExtTrapPortsExceedThreshold trap. 


## Meaning

The `NETELASTIC-FLEXBNG-ALARM::natExtTrapPatSessRateUpExceedThreshold` SNMP trap indicates that the rate of PORT Address Translation (PAT) sessions has exceeded a warning threshold. This means that the device is experiencing a high rate of PAT sessions, which may impact network performance and potentially lead to resource exhaustion.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that it may cause:

* Network congestion and reduced performance
* Increased latency and packet loss
* Potential dropped connections or sessions
* Increased risk of resource exhaustion, leading to device instability or failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of this trap, perform the following steps:

1. Check the current PAT session rate and compare it to the threshold value.
2. Identify the source of the PAT sessions (e.g., specific users, applications, or devices).
3. Verify that the NAT rule configuration is correct and optimal.
4. Check system logs for any errors or anomalies related to PAT sessions.
5. Analyze network traffic patterns to identify any unusual or suspicious activity.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, take the following steps:

1. Adjust the PAT session rate threshold to a more suitable value based on network requirements.
2. Implement traffic shaping or policing to limit the rate of PAT sessions.
3. Optimize NAT rule configurations to reduce the number of PAT sessions required.
4. Consider implementing additional network resources (e.g., increasing capacity or adding more devices) to handle the increased demand.
5. Monitor the network and device performance closely to detect any potential issues before they become critical.
