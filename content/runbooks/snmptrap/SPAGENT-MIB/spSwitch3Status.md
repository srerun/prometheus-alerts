# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch3Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap # SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch3Status:

## Meaning

This trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a threshold, causing the sensor status to change. The trap provides specific information about the sensor, including its status, value, and level exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch is experiencing a sensor-related issue, which may affect its operation or performance. This could lead to downtime, data loss, or other issues if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the **spSensorStatus** variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the **spSensorValue** variable to see the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the **spSensorLevelExceeded** variable to determine the level that was exceeded, causing the trap to be sent.
4. Use the **spSensorIndex** variable to identify the specific sensor causing the issue.
5. Review the **spSensorName** and **spSensorDescription** variables to understand the sensor's purpose and behavior.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance (e.g., environmental factors, hardware issues, software configuration).
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying cause (e.g., adjust environmental settings, replace hardware, update software configuration).
3. Monitor the sensor status and value to ensure the issue has been resolved.
4. If necessary, adjust the sensor threshold settings to prevent future exceedances.
5. Verify that the switch is operating normally and perform any necessary testing to ensure data integrity and system stability.
