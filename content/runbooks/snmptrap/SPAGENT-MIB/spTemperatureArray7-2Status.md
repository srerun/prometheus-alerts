# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-2Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-2Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a specified threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is generated by the sensor itself, which is part of a temperature array.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as it may indicate a potential overheating issue in the device or system being monitored. If left unchecked, this could lead to equipment failure, downtime, or even physical damage. The severity of the impact depends on the specific threshold exceeded and the criticality of the device or system being monitored.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Gather information**: Review the variables associated with this trap:
	* `spSensorStatus`: Check the current status of the sensor (e.g., normal, warning, critical).
	* `spSensorValue`: Review the current temperature value reported by the sensor.
	* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: Determine the threshold level that was exceeded.
	* `spSensorIndex`: Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
	* `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription`: Review the name and description of the sensor to understand its location and significance.
2. **Verify device status**: Check the current status of the device or system being monitored to determine if it is still operational.
3. **Check environmental conditions**: Investigate if there are any environmental factors contributing to the temperature increase (e.g., high ambient temperature, poor air circulation).

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Acknowledge and prioritize**: Acknowledge the trap and prioritize the issue based on the severity of the threshold exceeded and the criticality of the device or system being monitored.
2. **Investigate and correct**: Identify and address the root cause of the temperature increase (e.g., faulty cooling system, blocked airflow).
3. **Take corrective action**: Implement corrective measures to reduce the temperature (e.g., increase cooling capacity, improve airflow).
4. **Monitor and verify**: Continuously monitor the temperature sensor and verify that the corrective actions have resolved the issue.

Remember to follow your organization's specific procedures and guidelines for handling temperature-related alarms and to consult with subject matter experts if needed.
