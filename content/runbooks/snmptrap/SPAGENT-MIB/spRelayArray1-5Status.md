# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-5Status 

RelayArray1.5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-5Status SNMP trap indicates that a sensor in the RelayArray1.5 has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering a notification to be sent.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the system or device that is being monitored is operating outside of its normal parameters, which could lead to unexpected behavior, faults, or even failures. This could result in downtime, data loss, or other adverse consequences.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Check the **spSensorStatus** variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the **spSensorValue** variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
3. Compare the **spSensorValue** to the **spSensorLevelExceeded** variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the **spSensorIndex**, **spSensorName**, and **spSensorDescription** variables.
5. Consult the system or device documentation to understand the normal operating range of the sensor and the implications of exceeding that range.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Investigate and address the underlying cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold.
2. Take corrective action to bring the sensor reading back within its normal operating range.
3. Consider adjusting the threshold level to prevent future occurrences of this trap.
4. Perform additional monitoring and testing to ensure the system or device is operating correctly and safely.
5. Document the incident and the actions taken to resolve it for future reference and to improve incident response procedures.
