# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch24Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch24Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a specified level, triggering this trap to be sent.

## Impact
This trap may indicate a potential issue with the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or power supply, which could impact the switch's performance or even lead to hardware failure.

## Diagnosis

* Check the switch's sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
* Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor that triggered the trap.
* Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
* Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
* Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the nature of the sensor and the condition that triggered the trap.

## Mitigation

* Investigate the environmental conditions of the switch and take corrective action to address the issue, such as adjusting the cooling system or replacing a faulty power supply.
* Verify that the switch is operating within the recommended environmental specifications.
* Consider adjusting the sensor threshold levels to prevent false positives or unnecessary traps.
* If the issue persists, consider replacing the switch or contacting the manufacturer for further assistance.
