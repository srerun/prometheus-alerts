# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-6Status 

RelayArray8.6 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-6Status trap indicates that a sensor has exceeded a threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is related to the RelayArray8.6 sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor that has exceeded the threshold. Possible impacts include:

* Disruption to normal operations
* Potential hardware failure
* Overheating or other environmental issues
* Loss of data or system availability

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor name and description using the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine which sensor has exceeded the threshold.
2. Check the sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current state of the sensor.
3. Check the sensor value using the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
4. Check the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Check the sensor index using the `spSensorIndex` variable to determine the specific sensor that triggered the trap.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting environmental settings or performing maintenance on the sensor.
3. Monitor the sensor to ensure the issue has been resolved and the threshold is no longer being exceeded.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold levels to prevent future false alarms or to ensure timely notification of potential issues.
5. If necessary, escalate the issue to relevant teams or authorities for further investigation and resolution.
