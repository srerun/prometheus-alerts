RelayArray1.4 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-4Status trap is generated when the RelayArray1.4 sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating an issue with the sensor or the equipment it is monitoring. This trap is used to notify administrators of potential problems with the sensor or equipment, allowing them to take corrective action.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the equipment it is monitoring. If the sensor is critical to system operation, this trap may indicate a serious issue that requires immediate attention. If left unaddressed, the issue may result in system downtime, data loss, or equipment damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by examining the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status of the sensor by examining the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
4. Verify the threshold that was exceeded by examining the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the sensor reading.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the issue and take corrective action to address the underlying problem.
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and not producing false readings.
3. Check the equipment being monitored by the sensor to ensure it is operating within normal parameters.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold setting to prevent false alarms or to account for changes in system operation.
5. Document the incident and the resolution in the system's maintenance records.
