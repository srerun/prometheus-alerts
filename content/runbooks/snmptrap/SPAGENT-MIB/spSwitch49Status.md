  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch49Status trap indicates that a sensor on a switch has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering a warning or alarm. This trap provides information about the sensor's status, value, and the level that was exceeded, as well as the sensor's index, name, and description.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Overheating: If the sensor is measuring temperature, excessive heat can damage equipment or cause a fire.
* Power issues: If the sensor is measuring power consumption, excessive power usage can lead to equipment failure or electrical hazards.
* Environmental issues: If the sensor is measuring humidity, air flow, or other environmental factors, excessive deviations from normal levels can affect equipment operation or safety.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, gather information from the trap variables:

* `spSensorStatus`: Check the integer status of the sensor to determine the severity of the issue.
* `spSensorValue`: Review the current value of the sensor to understand the extent of the threshold exceedance.
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: Determine the specific level that was exceeded to understand the context of the issue.
* `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription`: Identify the specific sensor and its characteristics to focus troubleshooting efforts.

Next steps:

* Verify the sensor readings by checking the switch's monitoring system or logging into the switch directly.
* Check the switch's event logs for any related errors or warnings.
* Consult with facilities or maintenance personnel if the issue is related to environmental factors.

## Mitigation

Based on the diagnosis, take the following mitigation steps:

* For temperature-related issues:
	+ Check for proper airflow and cooling system function.
	+ Ensure that the switch is properly ventilated and not blocked by obstacles.
	+ Consider replacing the switch or moving it to a cooler location.
* For power-related issues:
	+ Check for proper power supply and distribution.
	+ Ensure that the switch is properly powered and not overloaded.
	+ Consider upgrading the power supply or redistributing the load.
* For environmental issues:
	+ Check for proper ventilation and air flow.
	+ Ensure that the switch is properly sealed and protected from the environment.
	+ Consider relocating the switch to a more suitable environment.

Remember to update the trap settings and threshold values as needed to prevent future occurrences of this trap.
