RelayArray5.2 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-2Status trap indicates that a sensor has exceeded a specific level, triggering this trap to be sent.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential issue with the sensor or the system being monitored. The specific impact will depend on the type of sensor and the system being monitored, but possible impacts include:

* System downtime or failure
* Data loss or corruption
* Inaccurate monitoring or reporting
* System instability or performance degradation

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, gather the following information from the trap:

* spSensorStatus: The current status of the sensor
* spSensorValue: The current value of the sensor
* spSensorLevelExceeded: The level that was exceeded, triggering the trap
* spSensorIndex: The index of the sensor
* spSensorName: The name of the sensor
* spSensorDescription: The description of the sensor

Using this information, investigate the following:

* Check the sensor's current value and level exceeded to understand the severity of the issue
* Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any related issues or patterns
* Consult with system administrators and subject matter experts to understand the impact of the sensor's status on the system
* Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, take the following steps:

* Acknowledge and investigate the trap immediately to minimize potential impact
* Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting sensor thresholds or performing maintenance on the system
* Verify that the sensor's status has returned to normal and that the system is stable
* Implement preventative measures to avoid similar issues in the future, such as regularly checking sensor values and performing routine maintenance.
