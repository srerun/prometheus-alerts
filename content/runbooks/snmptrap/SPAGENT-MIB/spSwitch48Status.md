# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch48Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch48Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent when a sensor on the switch detects a value that surpasses a predefined level, requiring attention from the network administrator.

## Impact
The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Temperature threshold exceeded: The switch may be at risk of overheating, which can lead to hardware failure or reduced performance.
* Power supply threshold exceeded: The switch may be operating outside of its recommended power specifications, which can lead to reduced performance or unexpected shutdowns.
* Other sensor thresholds exceeded: Depending on the specific sensor, the switch may be experiencing issues with voltage, current, or other environmental factors.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by examining the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Verify the `spSensorStatus` variable to ensure that the sensor is still reporting an exceeded threshold.
5. Check the switch's logs and environmental monitoring systems to gather more information about the issue.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the threshold exceedance, such as high ambient temperature or power supply issues.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting the switch's environment or replacing a faulty power supply.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a safe range by monitoring the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Clear the trap and acknowledge the resolution of the issue.
5. Update the switch's configuration or monitoring systems to prevent similar issues in the future.
