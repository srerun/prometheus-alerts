# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch46Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch46Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a threshold, triggering the trap to be sent. This trap is generated when a sensor on a switch reports a value that exceeds a predefined level.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch sensor is reporting an abnormal reading, which could indicate a potential issue with the switch or its environment. This could lead to reduced switch performance, overheating, or even complete failure if left unaddressed.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor by checking the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Verify the status of the sensor by checking the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. Consult the switch documentation to understand the normal operating range for the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the environmental conditions surrounding the switch to determine if there are any external factors contributing to the sensor reading.
2. Check the switch logs for any error messages or other indicators of a potential issue.
3. Perform a visual inspection of the switch to ensure that it is properly ventilated and that all fans are functioning correctly.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent false positives in the future.
5. If the issue persists, consider replacing the switch or the affected sensor to prevent complete failure.
