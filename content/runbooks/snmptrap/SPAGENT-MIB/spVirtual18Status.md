### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual18Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual18Status` trap is generated when a virtual sensor (sensor 18) reports an abnormal status or exceeded threshold. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its role in the system. If the virtual sensor is critical to system operations, this trap may indicate a potential system failure or performance degradation.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, investigate the following:

* Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
* Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor.
* Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
* Identify the sensor using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
* Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

* Verify that the virtual sensor is functioning correctly and is not reporting false data.
* Check the system configuration to ensure that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated.
* Investigate the root cause of the issue, such as a hardware failure or software bug.
* Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as replacing the sensor or updating software.
* Clear the trap and monitor the system to ensure the issue is resolved.
