# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS5Status 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS5Status trap is sent when an IRMS sensor detects a threshold exceedance. This trap indicates that a sensor has reached a critical level, potentially impacting system performance or functionality.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Reduced system performance
* Increased risk of component failure
* Decreased system reliability
* Potential data loss or corruption

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of the SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS5Status trap, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the affected sensor**: Check the `spSensorName` variable to determine which sensor triggered the trap.
2. **Determine the threshold exceeded**: Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the specific threshold that was exceeded.
3. **Check the sensor value**: Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
4. **Verify sensor status**: Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
5. **Review sensor description**: Check the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the purpose and functionality of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of the SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS5Status trap, follow these steps:

1. **Take corrective action**: Based on the sensor and threshold exceeded, take corrective action to address the underlying issue. This may include adjusting system settings, replacing components, or performing maintenance tasks.
2. **Monitor sensor values**: Continuously monitor the sensor values to ensure the issue is resolved and the sensor returns to a normal state.
3. **Adjust threshold settings**: Consider adjusting the threshold settings for the sensor to prevent future exceedances.
4. **Notify stakeholders**: Notify stakeholders of the issue and resolution to ensure awareness and minimize impact on business operations.
