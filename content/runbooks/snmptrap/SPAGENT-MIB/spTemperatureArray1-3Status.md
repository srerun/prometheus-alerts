# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-3Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

This trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering an alert to be sent to the monitoring system. The sensor is part of an array of temperature sensors, identified by the index `spSensorIndex`.

## Impact

* The excessive temperature reading may indicate a hardware failure or overheating issue that could lead to system downtime or data loss.
* If left unaddressed, the temperature excursion could cause permanent damage to the equipment.
* The impact may vary depending on the specific system and sensor location, but it is essential to investigate and take corrective action to prevent potential damage or loss.

## Diagnosis

* Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading that triggered the trap.
* Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
* Review the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor and its location.
* Check the system logs for any error messages or indicators of hardware failure.
* If possible, visually inspect the system and sensor to check for any signs of overheating or damage.

## Mitigation

* Immediately investigate the cause of the temperature excursion and take corrective action to bring the temperature back within a safe range.
* Check for any blockages or obstructions that may be preventing proper airflow and cooling.
* Verify that the system's cooling system is functioning correctly and adjust as necessary.
* Consider replacing the temperature sensor or the system component it is monitoring if it is deemed faulty.
* Implement additional monitoring and alerting measures to ensure that similar issues are detected and addressed promptly in the future.
