# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-6Status 

RelayArray2.6 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

This runbook is for the SNMP trap **SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-6Status**, also known as the RelayArray2.6 sensor trap. This trap is triggered when the RelayArray2.6 sensor reports an issue, and it provides detailed information about the sensor's status, value, and threshold levels.

## Impact

The impact of this trap on the system and network can be significant, as it may indicate a hardware failure or malfunction. This could lead to:

* Data loss or corruption
* System downtime
* Unavailability of critical resources
* Increased risk of further failures or errors

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to identify the threshold level that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to gather more information about the sensor and its purpose.

Additionally, review system logs and monitoring data to identify any patterns or trends that may be related to the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor and its connections to ensure they are secure and functioning properly.
2. Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated.
3. Review the threshold levels and adjust them if necessary to prevent false positives.
4. Perform a system reboot or reset the sensor if necessary.
5. If the issue persists, consider replacing the sensor or seeking further technical support.

By following these steps, you can quickly diagnose and mitigate the issue, minimizing the impact on your system and network.
