# SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual12Status 

Virtual12 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual12Status trap indicates that a virtual12 sensor has reached a critical level, triggering an alert. This trap is sent when the sensor value exceeds a predetermined threshold, and it provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the level exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate a potential issue with the system or device being monitored, such as overheating, high voltage, or other environmental concerns. If left unchecked, this could lead to system downtime, data loss, or even physical damage to the equipment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sensor**: Use the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor value**: Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. **Verify the threshold**: Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
4. **Check system logs**: Review system logs to see if there are any other errors or warnings related to the system or device being monitored.
5. **Physically inspect the system**: If possible, inspect the system or device being monitored to look for any signs of overheating, physical damage, or other issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Take corrective action**: Based on the diagnosis, take corrective action to address the issue. This may involve adjusting the system or device configuration, replacing a faulty component, or adjusting the environment to prevent overheating or other issues.
2. **Reset the sensor**: If the sensor value has returned to a safe level, reset the sensor to prevent further alerts.
3. **Update the threshold**: Consider updating the threshold value for the sensor to prevent future false alarms.
4. **Monitor the system**: Continue to monitor the system or device being monitored to ensure that the issue has been fully resolved.
5. **Document the incident**: Document the incident, including the root cause and the steps taken to resolve the issue, to improve future troubleshooting and prevention.
