# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent by the device to notify administrators of a potential thermal issue that requires attention.

## Impact

If left unaddressed, elevated temperatures can lead to reduced system performance, data loss, or even hardware failure. Ignoring this trap may result in:

* Decreased system availability
* Data corruption or loss
* Increased downtime for repair or replacement
* Potential hardware damage or failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor triggering the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Review the current temperature reading (`spSensorValue`) and the threshold that was exceeded (`spSensorLevelExceeded`).
3. Check the `spSensorDescription` for additional information about the sensor and its location.
4. Verify the device's environmental conditions, such as air flow, cooling system operation, and ambient temperature.
5. Review system logs for any other related errors or warnings.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and address any environmental issues, such as poor air circulation or high ambient temperatures.
2. Verify that the cooling system is functioning correctly and make any necessary adjustments.
3. Check for any blockages or obstructions that may be impeding air flow to the sensor.
4. Consider relocating the device to a cooler location or providing additional cooling measures.
5. If the issue persists, consider replacing the sensor or the device if necessary.
6. Update the temperature threshold settings if necessary to prevent future false positives.
7. Verify that the trap is cleared and the system is functioning normally.
