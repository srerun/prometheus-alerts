# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch1Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the given SNMP trap:

## Meaning

This trap is generated when a switch sensor reports a status that exceeds a certain level. The trap is sent to alert administrators of a potential issue with the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or power supply.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and level exceeded. However, potential impacts include:

* Decreased switch performance or reliability
* Increased risk of hardware failure
* Disruption of network services
* Downtime for troubleshooting and resolution

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Consult the switch's documentation and environmental monitoring systems to understand the normal operating range for the sensor.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and not reporting false readings.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the level. This may involve reviewing system logs, environmental monitoring data, and sensor readings.
2. Take corrective action to bring the sensor reading back within a safe range. This may involve adjusting environmental controls, replacing faulty sensors, or performing maintenance on the switch.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a safe range and the trap is no longer being generated.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold for the sensor to prevent future false positives or to provide earlier warning of potential issues.
5. Document the root cause of the issue and the steps taken to resolve it to improve future diagnosis and mitigation.
