# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature3Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature3Status` trap is sent when a temperature sensor exceeds a predefined threshold. This trap is generated by a temperature sensor, which is typically located in a network device or component, such as a router, switch, or server. The trap is triggered when the temperature reading exceeds a certain level, indicating a potential overheating issue.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as high temperatures can cause damage to network devices or components, leading to equipment failure, downtime, and potentially even data loss. In addition, high temperatures can also lead to a decrease in performance, causing slower network speeds and increased latency.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
2. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the temperature threshold that was exceeded.
3. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor and its location.
5. Verify that the temperature reading is accurate and not a false alarm.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the temperature reading is accurate and not a false alarm.
2. Check the network device or component for any blockages or obstructions that may be causing the high temperature.
3. Ensure that the device or component is properly ventilated and that air can circulate freely.
4. Consider relocating the device or component to a cooler location.
5. Check the device or component's thermal management system to ensure it is functioning properly.
6. Consider replacing the device or component if it is damaged or faulty.

Note: These steps are general guidelines and may vary depending on the specific network device or component and the environment in which it is operating.
