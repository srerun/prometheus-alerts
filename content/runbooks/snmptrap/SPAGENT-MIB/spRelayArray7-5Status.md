  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-5Status trap is generated when the RelayArray7.5 sensor exceeds a certain threshold. This trap indicates that the sensor has reported a value that is outside of its normal operating range.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the RelayArray7.5 sensor is not functioning within its normal parameters, which can affect the overall performance and reliability of the system. If left unattended, this issue can lead to system downtime, data loss, or equipment damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the sensor value using the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the threshold value using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor involved using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
5. Review the sensor name and description using the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the context of the sensor and its role in the system.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the system logs for any error messages related to the sensor or system fault.
2. Verify that the sensor is properly connected and configured.
3. Check the sensor calibration and adjust if necessary.
4. Perform a system reset or power cycle if necessary.
5. If the issue persists, contact the system administrator or vendor support for further assistance.

Note: The specific mitigation steps may vary depending on the system and sensor configuration.
