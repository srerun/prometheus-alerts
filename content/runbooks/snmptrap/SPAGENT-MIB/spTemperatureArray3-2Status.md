### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-2Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-2Status` SNMP trap is generated when a temperature sensor exceeds a predefined threshold. This trap is sent by the agent to notify the management system of a temperature anomaly that may indicate a potential issue with the device or system being monitored.

## Impact

A temperature sensor anomaly can have a significant impact on the device or system being monitored, potentially leading to:

* Equipment failure or damage
* Data loss or corruption
* System downtime or instability
* Increased maintenance or repair costs

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, gather the following information from the trap:

* `spSensorStatus`: The current status of the sensor (e.g., normal, warning, critical)
* `spSensorValue`: The current temperature value that triggered the trap
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: The threshold value that was exceeded
* `spSensorIndex`: The index of the sensor that triggered the trap
* `spSensorName`: The name of the sensor (e.g., "CPU Temperature")
* `spSensorDescription`: A brief description of the sensor

Verify the sensor readings and threshold values to determine the severity of the issue. Check the device or system logs for any related errors or warnings.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Acknowledge the trap**: Acknowledge the trap to prevent further notifications for the same issue.
2. **Verify the sensor readings**: Verify the sensor readings to determine if the temperature has returned to a normal range.
3. **Investigate the root cause**: Investigate the root cause of the temperature anomaly (e.g., faulty sensor, overheating, cooling system failure).
4. **Take corrective action**: Take corrective action to resolve the issue (e.g., replace the sensor, clean the system, repair or replace the cooling system).
5. **Monitor the system**: Continuously monitor the system to ensure the issue has been resolved and does not recur.

Remember to update the incident management system with the resolution details and perform a post-incident review to identify opportunities for improvement.
