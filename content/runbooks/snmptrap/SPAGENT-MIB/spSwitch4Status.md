# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch4Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch4Status:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch4Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has crossed a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent by the switch to notify administrators of a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

If left unaddressed, the issue triggering this trap could lead to:

* Reduced network performance or availability
* Increased risk of equipment failure or damage
* Downtime and disruption to business operations

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor that triggered the trap.
3. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Investigate the switch logs and monitoring data to gather more information about the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the issue causing the sensor to exceed the threshold (e.g., clean or replace the sensor, adjust the temperature in the room, etc.).
2. Verify that the switch is properly configured and that the sensor is functioning correctly.
3. Adjust the threshold level if necessary to prevent false alarms.
4. Consider implementing proactive monitoring and alerting to catch potential issues before they trigger a trap.
5. Document the issue and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference.
