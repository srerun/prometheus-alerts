# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-6Status 

RelayArray1.6 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap is triggered when the RelayArray1.6 sensor reports a status change. The sensor is likely a environmental monitoring sensor, and the trap is sent when a threshold is exceeded or a fault is detected.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its role in the environment. Possible impacts include:

* Environmental monitoring: If the sensor is monitoring temperature, humidity, or other environmental conditions, an exceeded threshold could indicate a potential issue that requires attention.
* Equipment operation: If the sensor is monitoring the operation of equipment, a fault or threshold exceedance could indicate a problem that needs to be addressed to prevent downtime or data loss.
* Service availability: In some cases, the sensor may be monitoring a critical component of a service, and a failure could impact service availability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Review the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the purpose and location of the sensor.
6. Consult the device documentation and logs to determine the root cause of the issue.
7. Perform any necessary troubleshooting or testing to isolate the problem.

## Mitigation

The mitigation steps will depend on the specific diagnosis and the type of sensor. Possible mitigation steps include:

* Adjusting the sensor threshold to prevent false positives.
* Performing maintenance or repairs on the equipment or sensor.
* Replacing the sensor or equipment if it is faulty.
* Implementing additional monitoring or logging to improve visibility into the environment.
* Notifying relevant stakeholders or teams of the issue and the planned mitigation steps.
