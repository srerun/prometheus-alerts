# SPAGENT-MIB::spCriticalStatus 

sensorProbe status went to Critical 



Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning
The `SPAGENT-MIB::spCriticalStatus` trap indicates that the sensorProbe status has transitioned to Critical. This trap is typically sent by the sensorProbe device when it encounters a critical fault or error that affects its ability to operate normally.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is high, as it indicates that the sensorProbe device is no longer functioning correctly. This can lead to a loss of visibility and monitoring capabilities, potentially causing issues to go undetected. The Critical status may also indicate a hardware or software failure, which can result in data loss or corruption.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the cause of the `SPAGENT-MIB::spCriticalStatus` trap, follow these steps:

* Check the sensorProbe device's logs for error messages or indications of the cause of the Critical status.
* Verify that the device is properly powered and connected to the network.
* Check for firmware or software updates that may be required to resolve the issue.
* Perform a diagnostic test on the sensorProbe device to identify any hardware faults.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the impact of the `SPAGENT-MIB::spCriticalStatus` trap, follow these steps:

* Immediately notify the relevant teams and stakeholders of the Critical status.
* Perform a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the issue.
* Implement a temporary workaround or backup solution to maintain monitoring capabilities.
* Prioritize the resolution of the issue, including applying firmware or software updates, replacing faulty hardware, or performing other necessary repairs.
* Verify that the sensorProbe device is functioning correctly before considering the issue resolved.
