### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-6Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-6Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold value. This trap is sent by the agent when the sensor value has crossed a predefined level, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as it may indicate a potential overheating issue in the device or system being monitored. If left unaddressed, this can lead to equipment failure, data loss, or even physical damage to the surrounding environment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, gather the following information from the trap:

* `spSensorStatus`: The current status of the sensor (e.g., normal, warning, critical).
* `spSensorValue`: The current value of the temperature sensor.
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: The threshold value that was exceeded, triggering the trap.
* `spSensorIndex`: The index of the sensor that triggered the trap.
* `spSensorName`: The name of the sensor (e.g., CPU temperature, ambient temperature).
* `spSensorDescription`: A brief description of the sensor.

Using this information, check the device or system for signs of overheating, such as:

* Elevated temperatures
* Increased fan speed or noise
* Sluggish performance
* Error messages or alarms from other sensors or systems

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, take the following steps:

* Verify the temperature reading to ensure it is accurate and not a false alarm.
* Check the device or system for blockages or obstructions that may be impeding airflow.
* Ensure that cooling systems (e.g., fans, air conditioning) are functioning correctly.
* Consider relocating the device or system to a cooler environment.
* If the issue persists, consider replacing the temperature sensor or the device/system itself.

Remember to update the monitoring system to reflect the resolution of the issue and to ensure that future traps are sent if the issue reoccurs.
