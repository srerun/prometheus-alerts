# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-8Status 

RelayArray2.8 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-8Status` indicates that the RelayArray2.8 sensor has triggered an alarm due to an exceeding threshold value. This trap is sent when the sensor detects an out-of-range condition.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the monitored entity (e.g. a device or system) is operating outside its normal parameters, which may lead to:

* Reduced performance
* Increased risk of failure
* Decreased reliability
* Potential downtime or data loss

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Compare the `spSensorValue` with the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the alarm using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold value.
2. Check the monitored entity's configuration and adjust as necessary.
3. Perform any necessary maintenance or repairs to bring the entity back within normal operating parameters.
4. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and adjust the threshold value if necessary.
5. Clear the alarm once the issue has been resolved and the sensor reading is back within normal range.
