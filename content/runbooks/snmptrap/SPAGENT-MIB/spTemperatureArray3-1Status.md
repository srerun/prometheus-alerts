# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-1Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-1Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides details about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the temperature in the affected area has reached a level that may be causing or may cause damage to equipment or compromise the environment. If left unchecked, this could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or even physical harm to individuals.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by looking at the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine the location and type of sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Investigate the affected area to determine the cause of the temperature increase.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature in the affected area. This may involve adjusting cooling systems, relocating equipment, or taking other measures to mitigate the heat.
2. Verify that the temperature has returned to a safe range by monitoring the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Perform a root cause analysis to determine why the temperature exceeded the threshold.
4. Take corrective action to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as adjusting temperature thresholds, improving cooling systems, or enhancing monitoring and alerting.
