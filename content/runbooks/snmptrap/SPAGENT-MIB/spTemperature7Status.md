# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature7Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a certain level, triggering an alarm. The trap is sent by the SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature7Status OID and provides information about the sensor that triggered the alarm, including its status, value, and level exceeded.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential issue with the system's temperature, which could lead to hardware failure or data loss if not addressed promptly. Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can cause damage to components, leading to downtime and lost productivity.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the alarm using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor's description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand its location and purpose.
5. Verify the sensor's status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to ensure it is functioning correctly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the high temperature reading, such as a faulty cooling system or environmental issues.
2. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as repairing or replacing the cooling system, improving air circulation, or relocating the system to a cooler environment.
3. Monitor the temperature sensor readings to ensure the issue has been resolved and the temperature has returned to a safe range.
4. Consider adjusting the temperature threshold level to prevent future false alarms or to provide earlier warnings of potential issues.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it to improve future response and prevention.
