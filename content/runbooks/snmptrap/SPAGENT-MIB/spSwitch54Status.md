# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch54Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning
This trap is generated when a switch sensor reports a status that exceeds a certain threshold. The sensor could be monitoring various aspects of the switch's health, such as temperature, power supply, or fan status.

## Impact
The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its current status. If the sensor is reporting a critical status, it could indicate a potential hardware failure or environmental issue that requires immediate attention. Ignoring this trap could lead to switch downtime, data loss, or even complete system failure.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Verify the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Check the threshold value that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Consult the switch's documentation and sensor descriptions to understand the implications of the sensor's status.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the sensor's status. This may involve replacing a faulty component, adjusting the switch's environment, or adjusting the sensor's threshold settings.
2. Verify that the sensor's status has returned to a normal state using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Update the switch's configuration to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
4. Perform additional testing to ensure that the switch is functioning correctly and that all sensors are reporting normal status.
5. Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting to detect similar issues proactively in the future.
