VRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS7Status`:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap indicates that a VRMS (Voltage Regulator Module) sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alarm. The trap provides detailed information about the sensor, including its current value, the level that was exceeded, and the sensor's index, name, and description.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential issue with the VRMS system, which could lead to reduced system reliability, performance, or even failure. The severity of the impact depends on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded, but it may require immediate attention from the operations team to prevent further damage or downtime.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Check the system logs and monitoring tools for any related errors or warnings.
6. Consult the VRMS system documentation and maintenance guides for troubleshooting steps specific to the affected sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Acknowledge the alarm and notify the relevant teams.
2. Verify the VRMS system is functioning within normal operating parameters.
3. If the issue is critical, consider initiating a failover to a redundant system or shutting down the affected component to prevent further damage.
4. Perform a thorough investigation to determine the root cause of the issue, including reviewing system logs, monitoring data, and maintenance records.
5. Implement corrective actions, such as adjusting sensor thresholds, performing maintenance tasks, or replacing faulty components, as needed.
6. Verify the issue is resolved and the VRMS system is operating normally before closing the incident.
