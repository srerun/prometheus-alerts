RelayArray3.3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3-3Status trap indicates that a sensor on the RelayArray3 has exceeded a threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent with associated variables that provide more information about the sensor and the threshold exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment overheating or cooling issues
* Power supply or electrical issues
* Environmental monitoring issues (e.g. humidity, temperature)
* Other equipment or system malfunctions

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Review the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Investigate the equipment or system associated with the sensor to identify the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying issue identified during diagnosis.
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and accurately reporting its readings.
3. Adjust the threshold settings for the sensor if necessary to prevent false alarms.
4. Perform additional testing or monitoring to ensure the issue is resolved and the system is stable.
5. Update documentation and procedures to reflect the changes made to the sensor or system.
