  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray4-6Status trap is triggered when a sensor on the RelayArray4.6 reaches a critical level, indicating a potential issue with the system. This trap provides critical information about the sensor's status, value, and level exceeded, allowing administrators to quickly identify and respond to the issue.

## Impact

* The system may be operating outside of normal parameters, potentially leading to equipment failure or data loss.
* If left unaddressed, the issue could escalate, causing further damage or downtime.
* The trap may indicate a hardware or software fault, requiring prompt attention to prevent further issues.

## Diagnosis

1. Verify the sensor name and description using the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor causing the trap.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor (e.g., OK, Warning, Critical).
3. Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
4. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded, triggering the trap.
5. Consult system logs and monitoring tools to identify any correlation with other system events or issues.

## Mitigation

1. Investigate the root cause of the issue, consulting system documentation and expert resources as needed.
2. Take corrective action to address the sensor reading, which may involve adjusting system settings, replacing hardware, or applying software patches.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal range and the trap is no longer being triggered.
4. Update system documentation and knowledge bases to reflect the issue and its resolution.
5. Consider implementing proactive monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
