: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual20Status` using level 2 headers:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual20Status` SNMP trap is generated when a virtual sensor exceeds a predefined threshold. This trap indicates that a sensor has reported a value that has exceeded a configured level, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and its role in the system. However, in general, this trap may indicate a potential problem or anomaly in the system that requires attention. The specific consequences of ignoring this trap may include:

* Unmonitored or unaddressed issues with system components
* Decreased system performance or reliability
* Increased risk of system downtime or failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Review the sensor description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context of the sensor reading.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is valid.
6. Investigate the system component related to the sensor to identify the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Address the root cause of the issue identified during diagnosis.
2. Adjust the sensor threshold or configuration as necessary to prevent false alarms.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is valid.
4. Implement any necessary repairs or maintenance to the system component related to the sensor.
5. Monitor the system to ensure that the issue does not recur.
