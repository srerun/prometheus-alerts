RelayArray5.6 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-6Status trap indicates that a sensor in Relay Array 5.6 has exceeded a specified level, triggering this trap to be sent.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the sensor reading has exceeded a predetermined threshold, which may indicate a potential issue with the relay array or its environment. This could lead to system downtime, data loss, or other adverse effects if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current sensor value using `spSensorValue` and the level that was exceeded using `spSensorLevelExceeded`.
3. Review the sensor description using `spSensorDescription` to understand the context of the sensor reading.
4. Consult system logs and monitoring tools to determine if there are any other related issues or alarms.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the specified level.
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause of the issue, such as adjusting environmental conditions or performing maintenance on the relay array.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal value and that the system is functioning correctly.
4. Update system logs and monitoring tools to reflect the resolution of the issue.
5. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent similar issues in the future.
