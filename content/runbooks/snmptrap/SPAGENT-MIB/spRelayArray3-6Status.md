### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3-6Status trap indicates that the RelayArray3.6 sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides vital information about the sensor's current status, value, and the level that was exceeded, helping teams quickly identify and address the issue.

## Impact
The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, it can indicate a potential issue with the RelayArray3.6 sensor, which may affect the overall system's performance, reliability, or safety. Ignoring this trap may lead to further complications, equipment damage, or even downtime.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to identify the current value of the sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor causing the issue.
5. Refer to the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the sensor's purpose and function.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the sensor's current value and the threshold that was exceeded to determine the root cause of the issue.
2. Check the sensor's configuration and settings to ensure they are correct and up-to-date.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and is not faulty.
4. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting the threshold or replacing the sensor if necessary.
5. Monitor the sensor's status and value to ensure the issue has been resolved and the system is operating within normal parameters.
