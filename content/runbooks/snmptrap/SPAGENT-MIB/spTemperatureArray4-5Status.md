# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-5Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-5Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold. This trap is generated by a sensor monitored by the SP Agent, and it provides detailed information about the sensor that triggered the trap.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its role in the system. A temperature sensor exceeding a threshold may indicate:

* Overheating equipment, which can lead to system crashes, data loss, or even physical damage.
* Cooling system failures or malfunctions.
* Environmental issues, such as high ambient temperatures or poor air circulation.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold value that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Verify the sensor's status using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. Consult the sensor's description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand its role in the system.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the temperature increase, considering factors such as equipment load, ambient temperature, and cooling system performance.
2. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as:
	* Reducing system load or shutting down non-essential components.
	* Improving air circulation or increasing cooling capacity.
	* Scheduling maintenance or replacing faulty components.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and providing accurate readings.
4. Adjust the threshold values or sensor configuration as needed to prevent false alarms or improve alarm sensitivity.
5. Monitor the system closely to ensure the issue is resolved and does not recur.
