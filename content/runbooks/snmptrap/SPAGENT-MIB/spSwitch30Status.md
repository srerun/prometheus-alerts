Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded

  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch30Status`:

## Meaning
This SNMP trap is generated when a switch sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential issue with the switch's environmental conditions.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that the switch's operation may be affected by the sensor reading, potentially leading to overheating, shutdown, or other performance issues. This can result in downtime, data loss, and revenue loss.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Check the switch's logs and monitoring systems for any other related alerts or issues.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading and take corrective action to address the underlying issue.
2. Verify that the switch's cooling system is functioning properly and that the environment is within the recommended temperature range.
3. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent future false positives.
4. Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect potential issues before they become critical.
5. Perform regular maintenance and checks on the switch and its sensors to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
