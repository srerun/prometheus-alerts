# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch56Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch56Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch56Status` trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a threshold value, triggering the trap to be sent. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the trap, including its status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

This trap can indicate a potential issue with the switch, such as overheating, high voltage, or other environmental factors. If left unaddressed, this issue could lead to hardware failure, downtime, or other problems that could impact network availability and reliability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine which sensor triggered the trap.
2. Review the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables to understand the current state of the sensor.
3. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check system logs and monitoring tools for other related issues or errors.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold value.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting the switch's environmental settings or replacing faulty hardware.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal state.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold value for the sensor to prevent future false alarms.
5. Update the switch configuration and monitoring tools to reflect the changes made.
