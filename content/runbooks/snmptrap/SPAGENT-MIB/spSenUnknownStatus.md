# SPAGENT-MIB::spSenUnknownStatus 

sensorProbe sensor status went to Unknown 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap # SPAGENT-MIB::spSenUnknownStatus:

## Meaning

The sensorProbe sensor status has changed to Unknown, indicating that the sensor is not functioning correctly or is reporting an unexpected value.

## Impact

* The monitoring system may not receive accurate or reliable data from the sensor, leading to potential issues with decision-making or automated actions.
* The Unknown status may indicate a hardware or software fault with the sensor or sensorProbe device.
* Depending on the criticality of the sensor and the system being monitored, this could lead to a significant impact on business operations or system availability.

## Diagnosis

1. Verify the sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine if the Unknown status is still present.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to see if the sensor is reporting a valid or expected value.
3. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine if the sensor has exceeded a threshold or limit.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor causing the issue.
5. Refer to the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to gather more information about the sensor and its role in the system.

## Mitigation

1. Check the sensorProbe device and sensor for any signs of physical damage or malfunction.
2. Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated.
3. Restart the sensorProbe device or sensor to see if the issue resolves itself.
4. If the issue persists, contact the vendor or manufacturer for support or replacement options.
5. Consider implementing additional monitoring or redundancy for critical sensors to minimize the impact of future issues.
