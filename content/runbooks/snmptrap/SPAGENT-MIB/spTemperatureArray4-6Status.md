# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-6Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the given SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-6Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold. This trap is generated when the temperature reading from a sensor in the temperature array 4-6 has exceeded a configured level.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the device or system being monitored may be experiencing a temperature issue that could potentially lead to component failure or system downtime. This could result in data loss, system crashes, or even physical damage to the equipment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the spSensorStatus variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the spSensorValue variable to obtain the current temperature reading.
3. Check the spSensorLevelExceeded variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the spSensorIndex variable.
5. Refer to the spSensorName and spSensorDescription variables to obtain more information about the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the temperature increase, such as a cooling system failure or blockage.
2. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as turning off unnecessary components or adjusting the cooling system.
3. Verify that the temperature sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
4. Consider adjusting the temperature threshold to prevent false alarms or to make the system more sensitive to temperature changes.
5. Schedule a maintenance check to ensure that the system is operating within safe temperature ranges.

By following these steps, you can quickly identify and address the temperature issue, minimizing the risk of system downtime and data loss.
