# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch5Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch5Status trap is a switch sensor trap that indicates a sensor on a switch has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering the trap to be sent. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the trap, including its status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential issue with the switch or its environment, such as overheating, power supply issues, or fan failures. If left unaddressed, this could lead to switch downtime, network outages, or even hardware damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine which sensor triggered the trap.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables to determine the current status and value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Verify the sensor readings and threshold values in the switch's configuration.
5. Check the switch's event logs for any other related errors or traps.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the sensor readings are accurate and not faulty.
2. Check the switch's environment to ensure it is within the recommended operating conditions.
3. Adjust the sensor threshold values if necessary to prevent future traps.
4. Perform any necessary maintenance or replacements to ensure the switch is operating within normal parameters.
5. Verify that the issue is resolved and the sensor readings are within normal ranges.

Note: The specific mitigation steps may vary depending on the switch model, sensor, and environment. This runbook should be tailored to the specific use case and infrastructure.
