# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-3Status 

RelayArray1.3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-3Status trap is generated when the RelayArray1.3 sensor detects an issue that requires attention. This trap is sent by the agent to notify administrators of a potential problem.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor status and value. However, it may indicate a hardware or environmental issue that could affect system performance, reliability, or availability. If left unaddressed, this issue may lead to system downtime, data loss, or other serious consequences.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the trap variables:
	* `spSensorStatus`: Determine the current status of the sensor (e.g., normal, warning, critical).
	* `spSensorValue`: Check the current value of the sensor (e.g., temperature, voltage, etc.).
	* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: Identify the threshold level that was exceeded, triggering the trap.
	* `spSensorIndex`: Note the index of the sensor that triggered the trap.
	* `spSensorName`: Verify the name of the sensor (e.g., temperature, fan, power, etc.).
	* `spSensorDescription`: Review the description of the sensor to understand its purpose and functionality.
2. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any patterns or correlations with other system components.
3. Verify the sensor's configuration and calibration to ensure it is functioning correctly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor issue, based on the diagnosis.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as:
	* Adjusting the sensor's configuration or calibration.
	* Replacing the sensor or associated hardware components.
	* Implementing environmental changes (e.g., temperature, humidity) to prevent similar issues.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and the issue is resolved.
4. Update system documentation and knowledge bases to reflect the issue and resolution.
5. Consider implementing proactive measures to prevent similar issues in the future, such as regular sensor maintenance or environmental monitoring.
