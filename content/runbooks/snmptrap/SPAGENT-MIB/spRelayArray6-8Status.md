# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-8Status 

RelayArray6.8 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-8Status trap indicates that a sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. The sensor is part of the RelayArray6.8 system, which is a component of the device.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor that triggered the alert. Possible impacts include:

* System downtime or malfunction
* Data loss or corruption
* Increased risk of hardware failure
* Decreased system performance
* Alert fatigue if the threshold is set too low

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the alert using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context of the alert.
5. Check the system logs for any related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the underlying cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold.
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause of the issue.
3. Adjust the threshold level if necessary to prevent future false alerts.
4. Implement measures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
5. Verify that the system is functioning correctly and the sensor value has returned to a normal range.

Note: The specific mitigation steps will depend on the underlying cause of the issue and the specific sensor that triggered the alert.
