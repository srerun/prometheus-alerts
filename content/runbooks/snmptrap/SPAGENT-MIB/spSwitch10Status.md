  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch10Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering this trap to be sent. This trap is used to notify administrators of potential issues with the switch's sensors.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch's sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, which may indicate a problem with the switch's operation or environment. This could potentially lead to switch downtime, data loss, or other issues if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Consult the switch's documentation and manufacturer's guidelines to determine the recommended course of action based on the sensor's status and value.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the predetermined level.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as adjusting the sensor's configuration or replacing the sensor if faulty.
3. Verify that the sensor is operating within the recommended range after taking corrective action.
4. Update the switch's configuration to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Consider implementing monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect similar issues proactively.
