# SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS4Status 

VRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS4Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS4Status` trap indicates that a VRMS (Voltage Regulator Module Sensor) sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering an alarm. This trap is sent by the SP Agent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the VRMS sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific threshold that was exceeded and the criticality of the sensor. If the threshold is critical, it may indicate a potential hardware failure or power supply issue, which could lead to system downtime or data loss. If left unaddressed, this issue could result in significant business disruption and revenue loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Review the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the purpose and functionality of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the threshold exceedance, such as a hardware fault or power supply issue.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the underlying issue, such as replacing a faulty component or adjusting the power supply configuration.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range.
4. Clear the trap and reset the sensor threshold if necessary.
5. Perform a thorough system check to ensure that the issue has been fully resolved and the system is stable.
