# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitchStatus 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitchStatus trap is generated when a switch sensor detects an abnormal condition. This trap indicates that one of the sensors on the switch has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the type of sensor and the threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Environmental issues (e.g. temperature, humidity)
* Power supply issues
* Cooling system failures
* Other hardware-related problems

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by examining the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status and value of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Review the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional context about the sensor and its function.
5. Verify the switch's environmental conditions, power supply, and cooling system to ensure they are within normal operating ranges.
6. Check the switch's event logs for any related errors or warnings.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and address the underlying cause of the sensor threshold exceedance.
2. Take corrective action to return the sensor value to a normal range (e.g. adjust temperature settings, replace a faulty component).
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and accurately reporting its status.
4. If the issue persists, consider replacing the sensor or the entire switch.
5. Update the switch's configuration to adjust the sensor threshold or alert levels as necessary to prevent future false positives.
6. Perform regular maintenance and monitoring of the switch's sensors and environmental conditions to prevent similar issues from occurring.
