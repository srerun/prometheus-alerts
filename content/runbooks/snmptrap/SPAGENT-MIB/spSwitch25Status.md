# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch25Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the given SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch25Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering the switch to send an alert to the network management system. This trap is sent when the sensor reading has crossed a certain level, indicating a potential issue with the switch's environment or operation.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the type of sensor that triggered the alert. Possible effects include:

* Temperature fluctuations that could affect switch operation or longevity
* Power supply issues that could lead to switch failure
* Fan failures that could cause overheating
* Other environmental factors that could impact switch performance or reliability

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Verify the sensor reading and threshold values to determine if the issue is legitimate or if it's a false alarm.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. If the sensor reading indicates a temperature issue, verify that the switch's cooling system is functioning properly and check for any blockages or obstructions.
2. If the sensor reading indicates a power supply issue, check the power supply redundancy and verify that the switch is receiving stable power.
3. If the sensor reading indicates a fan failure, replace the failed fan to prevent overheating.
4. Contact the switch vendor or a qualified technician to perform further troubleshooting and repair if necessary.
5. Once the issue is resolved, clear the trap and monitor the switch to ensure the issue does not recur.
