# SPAGENT-MIB::spNormalStatus 

sensorProbe status is Normal 



Here is a runbook using level 2 headers (##) for the sections with the meanings, impact, diagnosis, and mitigation for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spNormalStatus` SNMP trap is received when the sensorProbe status changes to Normal. This indicates that the sensorProbe, a network monitoring device, has resumed normal operation after a previously reported issue has been resolved.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is low, as it indicates that the sensorProbe is functioning normally and monitoring the network as expected. This trap can be considered informational, as it does not indicate any current issues or problems with the network or the sensorProbe.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the reason for this trap, check the sensorProbe's event logs and monitoring data to determine what issue was previously reported and how it was resolved. Verify that the sensorProbe is functioning correctly and reporting accurate monitoring data.

## Mitigation

No mitigation is required for this trap, as it indicates that the sensorProbe has returned to a normal operating state. However, it is recommended to review the sensorProbe's event logs and monitoring data to ensure that the previously reported issue has been fully resolved and to identify any potential root causes to prevent future issues.
