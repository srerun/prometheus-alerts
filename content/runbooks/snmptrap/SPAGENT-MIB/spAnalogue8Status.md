# SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue8Status 

Analogue Sensor Type 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue8Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue8Status` SNMP Trap is generated when an analogue sensor exceeds a specified level. This trap indicates that a sensor has reported a value that is above a predetermined threshold.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the sensor reading has exceeded a critical level, which may indicate a potential issue with the system or device being monitored. This could lead to equipment failure, downtime, or even safety risks if left unchecked.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, collect the following information:

* `spSensorStatus`: The current status of the sensor
* `spSensorValue`: The current value of the sensor
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: The level that was exceeded, triggering the trap
* `spSensorIndex`: The index of the sensor that triggered the trap
* `spSensorName`: The name of the sensor that triggered the trap
* `spSensorDescription`: The description of the sensor that triggered the trap

Use this information to determine the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded, and investigate the cause of the elevated reading.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Verify the sensor reading by checking the `spSensorValue` to ensure it is accurate.
2. Check the `spSensorDescription` to determine the type of sensor and the parameter being measured.
3. Investigate the cause of the elevated reading, such as equipment malfunction, environmental factors, or incorrect calibration.
4. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as repairing or replacing the sensor, or adjusting the system or device being monitored.
5. Monitor the sensor reading to ensure it returns to a normal range and does not persist.

By following these steps, you can quickly diagnose and mitigate the issue, preventing potential downtime or safety risks.
