# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-7Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-7Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is generated by a temperature sensor in the system, and it provides information about the sensor's current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the system's temperature has reached a critical level, which can potentially cause damage to the hardware or lead to system instability. If left unchecked, this can result in system downtime, data loss, or even permanent damage to the equipment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the **spSensorName** and **spSensorDescription** variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Verify the **spSensorValue** to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Check the **spSensorLevelExceeded** variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the **spSensorIndex** to locate the sensor in the system and check its physical condition.
5. Review system logs to see if there are any other related errors or warnings.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the physical environment to ensure that the system is not exposed to extreme temperatures.
2. Check the system's cooling system to ensure it is functioning properly.
3. Verify that the temperature sensor is not faulty and that the reading is accurate.
4. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as increasing airflow, replacing cooling fans, or relocating the system to a cooler environment.
5. Once the temperature has returned to a safe level, clear the trap and monitor the system to ensure the issue does not reoccur.
