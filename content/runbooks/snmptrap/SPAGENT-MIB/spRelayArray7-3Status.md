# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-3Status 

RelayArray7.3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-3Status trap indicates that the RelayArray7.3 sensor has triggered an event that requires attention. This sensor is likely monitoring environmental conditions, such as temperature or humidity, in a data center or network closet.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor threshold that has been exceeded. If the sensor is monitoring a critical component, such as a temperature sensor in a server room, exceeding the threshold could indicate a potential overheating issue that may lead to equipment failure or downtime. In less critical scenarios, the impact may be limited to minor disruptions or notifications.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the type of sensor and what it is monitoring.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the environmental conditions surrounding the sensor to determine the root cause of the threshold exceedance.
2. Take corrective action to address the issue, such as adjusting cooling systems or replacing faulty equipment.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the readings are accurate.
4. Adjust the sensor threshold or notification settings as needed to prevent future false positives.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference.
