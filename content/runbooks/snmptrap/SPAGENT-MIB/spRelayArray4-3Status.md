# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray4-3Status 

RelayArray4.3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray4-3Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray4-3Status` trap is generated when a sensor on the RelayArray4.3 exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential issue with the sensor or the system being monitored. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential problem that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Increased risk of system failure or downtime
* Decreased performance or efficiency
* Potential data loss or corruption
* Alert fatigue if the trap is not properly addressed

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Gather information**: Review the variables associated with the trap:
	* `spSensorStatus`: The current integer status of the sensor
	* `spSensorValue`: The current integer value of the sensor
	* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: The integer level that was exceeded
	* `spSensorIndex`: The integer index of the sensor
	* `spSensorName`: The name of the sensor
	* `spSensorDescription`: The description of the sensor
2. **Identify the sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
3. **Determine the threshold**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. **Check the sensor value**: Use the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the cause**: Determine why the sensor exceeded the threshold. This may involve reviewing system logs, checking environmental conditions, or consulting with subject matter experts.
2. **Take corrective action**: Based on the cause, take corrective action to address the issue. This may involve adjusting system settings, replacing hardware, or initiating maintenance procedures.
3. **Verify the fix**: Once the issue is addressed, verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range and the trap is no longer being generated.
4. **Update monitoring and alerting**: Review and update monitoring and alerting configurations to ensure that similar issues are detected and addressed in a timely manner.
