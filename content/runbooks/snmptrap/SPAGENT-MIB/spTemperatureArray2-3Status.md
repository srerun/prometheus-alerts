### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray2-3Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering this alert. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and threshold.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as high temperatures can cause damage to equipment, lead to downtime, and result in data loss. It is essential to investigate and address the issue promptly to prevent further damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` to understand the context of the sensor and the equipment it is monitoring.
5. Verify the status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the equipment associated with the sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Verify that the equipment is operating within a safe temperature range.
3. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as adjusting cooling settings or replacing faulty components.
4. Monitor the temperature sensor closely to ensure the issue is resolved and the temperature returns to a safe range.
5. Update the sensor threshold or adjust the alerting configuration as necessary to prevent similar alerts in the future.
