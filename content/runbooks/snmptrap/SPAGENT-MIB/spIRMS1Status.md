# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS1Status 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS1Status trap is generated when an IRMS (Intelligent Remote Management Sensor) sensor detects an unusual condition that exceeds a predefined threshold. This trap is used to notify administrators of potential issues with the sensor or the equipment it is monitoring.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is dependent on the specific sensor and the condition that triggered the trap. Possible impacts include:

* Loss of sensor data: If the sensor is not functioning correctly, it may not provide accurate data, which can lead to inaccurate monitoring and decision-making.
* Equipment failure: If the sensor is monitoring equipment temperature, voltage, or other critical parameters, an unusual condition may indicate a potential failure.
* System downtime: Depending on the criticality of the equipment and the sensor, a malfunctioning sensor can lead to system downtime and revenue loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Verify the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Check the level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Consult the sensor documentation and the equipment documentation to understand the implications of the exceeded level.
6. Check the system logs for any related errors or events.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor for any physical issues, such as loose connections or blockages.
2. Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated.
3. Check the equipment being monitored for any signs of malfunction or failure.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent false positives.
5. Implement additional monitoring and logging to detect similar issues in the future.
6. Escalate the issue to the equipment owner or responsible team for further investigation and resolution.

By following these steps, administrators can quickly diagnose and mitigate the issue, minimizing the impact on the system and ensuring timely resolution.
