# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch26Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch26Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact
This trap may indicate a potential issue with the switch's operating environment, such as overheating, high fan speed, or other conditions that may affect the switch's performance or reliability. If left unchecked, this could lead to reduced system availability, data loss, or even hardware failure.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the type of sensor and the implications of the exceeded threshold.
5. Verify the switch's operating environment, such as temperature, humidity, and power supply, to ensure they are within recommended specifications.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the sensor exceedance, such as adjusting the switch's operating environment or performing maintenance tasks.
2. Verify that the switch is functioning correctly and is not showing any signs of hardware failure.
3. Check the switch's log for any other error messages or alerts that may be related to the sensor exceedance.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold values for the sensor to prevent future exceedances.
5. Update the switch's configuration and monitoring settings to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
