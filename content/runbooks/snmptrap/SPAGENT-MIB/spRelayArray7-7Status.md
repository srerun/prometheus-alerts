# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-7Status 

RelayArray7.7 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-7Status trap indicates that a sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is specific to the RelayArray7.7 sensor and provides information about the sensor's status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

* The relay array sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, which may indicate a potential issue with the equipment or environment.
* If left unchecked, this could lead to equipment failure, downtime, or data loss.
* This trap may also indicate a false alarm or sensor malfunction, which requires investigation to determine the root cause.

## Diagnosis

* Review the trap details to identify the specific sensor (spSensorName and spSensorDescription) and its current value (spSensorValue).
* Check the sensor status (spSensorStatus) to determine if it is in an error or warning state.
* Verify the level that was exceeded (spSensorLevelExceeded) to understand the severity of the issue.
* Check the sensor index (spSensorIndex) to identify the specific sensor in the array.
* Review system logs and monitoring tools to identify any related issues or errors.

## Mitigation

* Investigate the root cause of the issue, considering factors such as environmental conditions, equipment failure, or sensor malfunction.
* Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as adjusting environmental settings, replacing equipment, or calibrating the sensor.
* Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range and the status is no longer in an error or warning state.
* If the issue is resolved, clear the trap and update the system logs.
* If the issue cannot be resolved, escalate to a higher-level support team or notify stakeholders of the ongoing issue.
