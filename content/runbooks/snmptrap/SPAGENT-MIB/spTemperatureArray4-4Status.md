# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-4Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-4Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering this notification. This trap is used to inform network administrators of a potential issue with the temperature in a specific area or device.

## Impact

* The device or area where the temperature sensor is located may be at risk of overheating, which can cause damage to equipment or pose a fire hazard.
* Network performance may be impacted if the device or area is critical to network operations.
* If left unaddressed, the issue may lead to device failure or data loss.

## Diagnosis

* Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the temperature sensor.
* Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
* Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
* Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
* Check device logs and monitoring systems for any related errors or issues.
* Perform a visual inspection of the device or area to verify the temperature reading.

## Mitigation

* Verify that the device or area is properly ventilated and that air vents are not blocked.
* Check for any blockages or obstructions that may be causing the temperature to rise.
* Consider relocating the device or area to a cooler location.
* Check the temperature sensor for any signs of failure or malfunction.
* Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as turning off unnecessary devices or reducing the load on the device or area.
* Consider implementing additional temperature monitoring and alerting to ensure prompt notification of any future issues.
