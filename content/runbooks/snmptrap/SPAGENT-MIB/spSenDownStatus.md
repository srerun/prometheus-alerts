# SPAGENT-MIB::spSenDownStatus 

sensorProbe sensor status went to Disabled 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSenDownStatus SNMP trap indicates that a sensor probe sensor status has changed to Disabled. This trap is generated when a sensor on a device (such as a temperature, humidity, or voltage sensor) becomes unavailable or non-functional.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the monitoring system will no longer receive sensor data from the affected sensor, which can lead to:

* Loss of visibility into the environmental conditions of the device or system being monitored
* Potential for undetected issues or faults that could lead to system downtime or data loss
* Inability to trigger automated responses or alerts based on sensor data

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to check the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine if the sensor has exceeded a specific threshold.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Check the device logs and event history for any errors or issues related to the sensor.
6. Physically inspect the sensor and its connections to ensure they are secure and functioning properly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor documentation and manufacturer's guidelines for troubleshooting and repair procedures.
2. Restart the sensor or the device it is connected to, if possible.
3. Replace the sensor if it is faulty or damaged.
4. Adjust the sensor threshold levels to prevent future false alarms.
5. Update the monitoring system configuration to account for the changed sensor status.
6. Verify that the sensor is properly calibrated and configured to ensure accurate readings.
