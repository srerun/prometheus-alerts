# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-4Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-4Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a specified threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that the system may be operating outside of its recommended temperature range, which can lead to reduced performance, premature component failure, or even system failure. Ignoring this trap can result in costly downtime and repairs.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, check the following variables:
- spSensorStatus: The current status of the sensor (e.g., OK, Warning, Critical)
- spSensorValue: The current temperature reading
- spSensorLevelExceeded: The threshold value that was exceeded
- spSensorIndex: The index of the sensor causing the trap
- spSensorName: The name of the sensor causing the trap
- spSensorDescription: The description of the sensor causing the trap

Verify that the temperature reading is accurate and not a false alarm. Check the sensor's configuration and threshold settings to ensure they are correct. Review system logs for any other related errors or issues.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue:
1. Investigate the cause of the high temperature reading (e.g., malfunctioning cooling system, blocked air vents, etc.).
2. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature (e.g., shut down non-essential systems, activate additional cooling measures, etc.).
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and adjust the threshold settings as needed.
4. Schedule maintenance to address the underlying issue and prevent future occurrences.
5. Monitor the system closely to ensure the temperature returns to a safe range and remains stable.
