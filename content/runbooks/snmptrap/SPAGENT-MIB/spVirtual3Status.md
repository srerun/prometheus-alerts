# SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual3Status 

Virtual3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual3Status trap indicates that a virtual sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* System overheating or cooling issues if the sensor is related to temperature
* Power supply issues if the sensor is related to voltage or current
* Reduced system performance or availability if the sensor is related to system resources (e.g., CPU, memory, or disk usage)

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor by examining the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold that was exceeded by checking the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Verify the status of the sensor by checking the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any patterns or trends that may be related to the sensor reading.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and address the root cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold.
2. Take corrective action to bring the sensor reading back within a safe range (e.g., adjust cooling systems, replace faulty components, or reduce system load).
3. Validate that the sensor reading has returned to a safe range and the system is operating within normal parameters.
4. Update monitoring configurations and thresholds as needed to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference and knowledge sharing.
