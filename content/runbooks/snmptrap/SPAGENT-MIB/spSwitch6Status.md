  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch6Status trap is generated when a switch sensor reaches a critical level, indicating a potential issue with the switch's environmental conditions. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential problem that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as it may indicate a serious issue with the switch's operating environment. If left unaddressed, this could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or even a complete system shutdown.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName`.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor using `spSensorValue`.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` value to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Review the `spSensorDescription` to understand the type of sensor and the condition being monitored.
5. Verify the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or power supply, to determine if there are any issues that could be contributing to the sensor reading.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the environmental condition that triggered the trap.
2. Verify that the switch is operating within the recommended environmental specifications.
3. Check the switch's logs for any other error messages or issues that may be related to the sensor reading.
4. Consider adjusting the sensor threshold levels to prevent future false positives.
5. If the issue persists, consider replacing the sensor or the switch itself if necessary.
