# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch53Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch53Status` trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering the trap to be sent. This trap is used to notify administrators of potential issues with the switch's sensors.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Environmental issues (e.g. temperature, humidity)
* Power supply issues
* Connectivity problems

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Review the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the type of sensor and its function.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance (e.g. environmental issue, equipment malfunction).
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause of the issue (e.g. adjust environmental controls, replace faulty equipment).
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and within normal parameters.
4. Clear the trap and resume normal monitoring.
5. Consider adjusting the sensor threshold or notification settings to prevent false positives or unnecessary notifications.
