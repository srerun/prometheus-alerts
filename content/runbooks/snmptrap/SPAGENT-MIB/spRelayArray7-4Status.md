# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-4Status 

RelayArray7.4 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is the runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-4Status trap indicates that the RelayArray7.4 sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering this trap to be sent. This trap provides information about the current status and value of the sensor, as well as the threshold level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the thresholds configured. However, in general, this trap may indicate a potential issue with the sensor or the system being monitored. Ignoring this trap could lead to further complications or even system downtime.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold level that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the type and purpose of the sensor.
6. Review system logs and monitoring data to see if there are any other related issues or symptoms.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold level.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting system settings or replacing a faulty sensor.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the threshold level is set appropriately.
4. Clear the trap and verify that it does not recur.
5. Update system documentation and sensor configurations as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
