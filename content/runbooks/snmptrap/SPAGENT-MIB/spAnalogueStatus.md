# SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogueStatus 

Analogue Sensor Type 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

This SNMP trap, SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogueStatus, indicates that an analogue sensor has exceeded a configured threshold or has changed state. The trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the event, including its status, value, and threshold level.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the type of sensor and the environment it is monitoring. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Environmental issues (e.g. temperature, humidity) that can affect equipment or personnel
* Safety risks (e.g. fire, hazardous materials)

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, gather the following information from the trap:

* spSensorStatus: The current status of the sensor
* spSensorValue: The current value of the sensor
* spSensorLevelExceeded: The threshold level that was exceeded
* spSensorIndex: The index of the sensor
* spSensorName: The name of the sensor
* spSensorDescription: The description of the sensor

Use this information to determine the type of sensor and the specific issue that triggered the trap. Check the sensor's configuration and historical data to determine if the issue is a one-time event or a recurring problem.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

* Acknowledge the trap and notify the relevant teams or personnel
* Check the sensor's configuration and adjust the threshold levels if necessary
* Investigate the cause of the issue, such as equipment failure or environmental factors
* Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as replacing equipment or adjusting environmental controls
* Verify that the issue has been resolved and the sensor is functioning correctly
