IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The IRMS sensor trap is generated when an IRMS (Intelligent Runtime Management System) sensor detects an abnormal condition. This trap is sent when a sensor's status exceeds a predefined level, indicating a potential issue with the system.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and the level exceeded. However, it can lead to:

* Reduced system performance
* Increased risk of system failure
* Unplanned downtime
* Data loss or corruption

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by referencing the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status and value of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables.
3. Compare the current value to the level exceeded (`spSensorLevelExceeded`) to understand the severity of the issue.
4. Review the sensor description (`spSensorDescription`) to understand the implications of the exceeded level.
5. Check system logs and monitoring tools for related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the sensor trigger, based on the diagnosis.
2. Refer to system documentation and manufacturer guidelines for specific procedures to resolve the issue.
3. Update the sensor configuration or threshold levels as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
4. Verify that the issue is resolved by monitoring the sensor status and system performance.
5. Update incident records and notify stakeholders of the resolution.
