: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-3Status` with sections for meaning, impact, diagnosis, and mitigation:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-3Status` trap is generated when the RelayArray5.3 sensor reports a status change. This trap is sent with various variables that provide more information about the sensor and its current state.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor status and value. However, in general, it may indicate a problem with the RelayArray5.3 sensor or the system it is monitoring. This could lead to issues with system reliability, performance, or even safety.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
3. Verify if the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable indicates that a threshold has been breached.
4. Identify the sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Consult the system documentation and sensor specifications to understand the expected behavior and thresholds.
6. Check the system logs for any related errors or events.

## Mitigation

Depending on the diagnosis, perform one or more of the following steps to mitigate the issue:

* If the sensor status indicates a fault, replace or repair the sensor as needed.
* If the sensor value exceeds a threshold, take corrective action to bring the system back within operating parameters.
* Verify that the system is properly configured and that the sensor is properly calibrated.
* Consider adjusting the sensor threshold or alarm settings to prevent false positives.
* Perform additional troubleshooting to identify the root cause of the issue and take preventative measures to prevent it from happening again.
