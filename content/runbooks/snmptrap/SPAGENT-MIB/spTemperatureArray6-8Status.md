### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-8Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold value, triggering an alert. This trap is sent by a network device, such as a router or switch, to notify administrators of a potential issue.

## Impact

* The affected device may be experiencing overheating, which can lead to reduced performance, errors, or even hardware failure.
* Depending on the severity of the temperature excursion, the device may shut down or become unstable, disrupting network operations.
* Ignoring this alert may lead to equipment damage, data loss, or service outages.

## Diagnosis

* Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
* Verify the current temperature value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
* Check the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
* Review the device's system logs for any related errors or events.
* Physically inspect the device to ensure proper airflow and cooling.

## Mitigation

* Take immediate action to reduce the temperature of the affected device, such as:
	+ Ensuring proper airflow and cooling in the device's environment.
	+ Cleaning dust from the device's air vents and fans.
	+ Verifying that the device's cooling system is functioning correctly.
* Consider relocating the device to a cooler location or providing additional cooling measures, such as fans or air conditioning.
* If the issue persists, consider replacing the device or upgrading its cooling system.
* Monitor the device's temperature sensors and system logs to ensure the issue has been resolved and to prevent future occurrences.
