# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5Status 

RelayArray5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5Status` SNMP trap indicates that a sensor in the RelayArray5 has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent with additional variables that provide more information about the sensor and the condition that triggered the trap.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate a potential issue with the environment or equipment being monitored, such as:

* Overheating or cooling issues
* Power supply problems
* Fan failure or other mechanical issues
* Environmental issues such as humidity or air quality

The specific impact will depend on the type of sensor and the threshold that was exceeded.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Determine the type of sensor and the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables.
3. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Compare the current value to the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Investigate the environment or equipment being monitored to determine the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Address the root cause of the issue, such as resolving overheating or cooling issues, or replacing failed fans or other mechanical components.
2. Adjust the threshold value for the sensor to prevent future false alerts.
3. Clear the trap by resetting the sensor or acknowledging the alert in the monitoring system.
4. Verify that the issue is resolved by checking the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
5. Update the monitoring system to reflect the resolved status of the trap.
