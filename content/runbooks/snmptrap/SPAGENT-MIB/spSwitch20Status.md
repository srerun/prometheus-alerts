### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch20Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch20Status` SNMP trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a certain threshold or status, triggering an alert. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the type of sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Overheating: If the sensor measures temperature, exceeding a certain threshold could indicate a risk of equipment failure or damage.
* Power outages: If the sensor measures power, exceeding a certain threshold could indicate a risk of power loss or equipment failure.
* Environmental issues: If the sensor measures environmental factors such as humidity or airflow, exceeding a certain threshold could indicate a risk to equipment reliability or safety.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by referencing the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
2. Determine the current status and value of the sensor by referencing the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables.
3. Determine the threshold that was exceeded by referencing the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold, such as a failure in the cooling system or a power supply issue.
5. Check the switch logs for any related error messages or events.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold, such as repairing or replacing a faulty cooling system or power supply.
2. Verify that the sensor is working correctly and that the threshold has been reset.
3. Monitor the sensor closely to ensure that the issue does not recur.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold or alarm settings to prevent false positives or unnecessary alerts.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it in the incident management system.
