# SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy7Status 

Energy sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy7Status trap is sent when an energy sensor has exceeded a certain level, indicating a potential issue with the sensor or the system it is monitoring.

## Impact
If left unaddressed, this issue may lead to:

* Inaccurate energy readings
* Failure to detect energy-related problems
* Inefficient energy usage
* Potential equipment damage or failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
5. Review the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the sensor's purpose and what it is monitoring.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the level (e.g., equipment failure, environmental factors, etc.).
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause of the issue (e.g., replace faulty equipment, adjust environmental conditions, etc.).
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and providing accurate readings.
4. Reset the sensor or clear the exceeded level if necessary.
5. Monitor the sensor for a period of time to ensure the issue is resolved and the sensor is functioning correctly.

By following this runbook, you should be able to diagnose and mitigate the issue causing the SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy7Status trap, ensuring that your energy sensors are functioning correctly and providing accurate readings.
