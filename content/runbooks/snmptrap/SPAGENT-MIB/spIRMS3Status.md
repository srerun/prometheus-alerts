# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS3Status 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

This runbook is intended to provide guidance for responding to an IRMS sensor trap, specifically the `SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS3Status` trap. This trap is sent when an IRMS sensor reports a status change, indicating a potential issue with the sensor or the system it is monitoring.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and system being monitored. However, in general, this trap may indicate a potential issue with the sensor or system that could lead to:

* Loss of monitoring data
* Inaccurate readings
* System downtime
* Decreased system reliability

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded, causing the trap to be sent.
4. Identify the sensor that generated the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to determine if there are any other indications of a system issue.
6. Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. If the sensor status indicates a fault, attempt to reset the sensor or replace it if necessary.
2. If the sensor value indicates an abnormal reading, investigate the cause of the reading and take corrective action as necessary.
3. If the sensor level exceeded indicates a critical threshold has been reached, take immediate action to address the issue and prevent further damage.
4. Verify that the system is properly configured and functioning as expected.
5. Consider implementing additional monitoring or logging to prevent similar issues in the future.

Note: The specific mitigation steps may vary depending on the system and sensor being monitored. This runbook provides general guidance, and further investigation and analysis may be necessary to fully resolve the issue.
