# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-1Status 

RelayArray6.1 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-1Status trap indicates that a sensor on the RelayArray6.1 has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. This sensor is critical to the system's operation, and immediate attention is required to prevent potential downtime or data loss.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is high, as it indicates a potential issue with the RelayArray6.1 sensor that could affect system performance, availability, or data integrity. If left unaddressed, this issue could lead to:

* System downtime or crashes
* Data loss or corruption
* Inaccurate sensor readings
* Performance degradation

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor causing the trap: Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine which sensor is affected.
2. Check the sensor status: Review the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Analyze the sensor value: Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
4. Verify the threshold: Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Consult sensor documentation: Review the sensor documentation to understand the expected behavior and potential causes of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the sensor: Perform a detailed investigation of the sensor to determine the root cause of the issue.
2. Adjust the threshold: Consider adjusting the threshold value to prevent false alerts or to better reflect the expected behavior of the sensor.
3. Perform maintenance: Schedule maintenance to clean, calibrate, or replace the sensor as necessary.
4. Monitor the sensor: Closely monitor the sensor to ensure the issue is resolved and does not reoccur.
5. Update documentation: Update the sensor documentation to reflect any changes made during the mitigation process.

By following this runbook, you can quickly identify and address issues related to the RelayArray6.1 sensor, minimizing the impact on system performance and availability.
