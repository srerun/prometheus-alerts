# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-6Status 

RelayArray7.6 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-6Status trap indicates that the RelayArray7.6 sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its role in the system. However, in general, a sensor exceeding its threshold can indicate a potential hardware or environmental issue that may affect system performance or reliability. If left unaddressed, this issue may lead to more severe problems, such as system downtime or data loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current state of the sensor.
2. Verify the sensor value using the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading.
3. Check the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any patterns or trends that may be related to the sensor issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance, such as environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) or hardware issues.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying cause, such as adjusting environmental settings or replacing faulty hardware.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal state using the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. If necessary, adjust the threshold level using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to prevent future false positives.
5. Update system documentation and monitoring configurations to reflect any changes made to the sensor or its threshold.
