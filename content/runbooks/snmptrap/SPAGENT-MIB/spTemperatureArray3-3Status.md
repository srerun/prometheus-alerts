# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-3Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3-3Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold value. This trap is generated by a Cisco device and indicates a potential environmental issue that requires attention.

## Impact

If this trap is not addressed, it could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or even physical damage to the device or surrounding infrastructure. Temperature sensors are critical for monitoring environmental conditions that can affect device operation and overall system reliability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` to determine the current temperature reading that exceeded the threshold.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` to correlate the sensor data with other monitoring tools or logs.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any trends or patterns that may indicate the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the high temperature reading, such as a faulty sensor, poor air circulation, or equipment malfunction.
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause, such as replacing the sensor, improving air flow, or repairing/Replacing the malfunctioning equipment.
3. Verify that the temperature reading has returned to a safe range and the trap is no longer generating.
4. Update monitoring configurations and thresholds as necessary to prevent future false positives or undetected issues.
5. Document the incident and root cause analysis for future reference and improvement.
