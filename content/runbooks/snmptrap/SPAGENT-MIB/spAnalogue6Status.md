# SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue6Status 

Analogue Sensor Type 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue6Status trap is generated when an analogue sensor type has exceeded a predetermined threshold level. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the sensor or the system being monitored.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and system being monitored. However, it may indicate a potential problem with the system, such as overheating, excessive vibrations, or other environmental issues. If left unchecked, these issues can lead to system downtime, data loss, or even physical damage to equipment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold level that was exceeded.
4. Review the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context of the sensor and the potential impact of the issue.
5. Check system logs and other monitoring tools to see if there are any other related issues or errors.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold level. This may involve checking environmental conditions, system configurations, or other potential factors.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue. This may involve adjusting system settings, replacing faulty components, or implementing additional monitoring or alerting mechanisms.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal range and that the system is stable.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent false positives or to improve sensitivity to real issues.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it to improve future response and prevention.
