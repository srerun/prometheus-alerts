Virtual6 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual6Status:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap indicates that a virtual6 sensor has triggered an alert. The virtual6 sensor is a monitoring point that tracks environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or voltage, in a virtualized environment.

## Impact

If this trap is triggered, it may indicate a potential issue with the environmental conditions in the virtualized environment. This could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or system downtime. It is essential to investigate and address the issue promptly to prevent any adverse effects on the system.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded, causing the trap to be sent.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the type of sensor and its purpose.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify the virtual6 sensor settings and threshold levels to ensure they are correctly configured.
2. Investigate the environmental conditions in the virtualized environment to determine the root cause of the issue.
3. Take corrective action to address the environmental condition that triggered the trap, such as adjusting the cooling system or replacing a failed component.
4. Clear the trap and verify that the sensor status has returned to normal.
5. Monitor the virtual6 sensor closely to ensure that the issue does not recur.
