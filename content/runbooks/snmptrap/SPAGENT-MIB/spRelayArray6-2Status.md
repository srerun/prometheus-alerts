# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-2Status 

RelayArray6.2 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-2Status trap indicates that the RelayArray6.2 sensor has triggered an alert. This sensor is monitoring a specific component or system, and its reading has exceeded a predefined threshold.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the system it is monitoring. However, in general, it may indicate a potential issue or fault that requires attention. The sensor reading may be indicating a problem with temperature, voltage, current, or other environmental or system-related factors.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the sensor using the `spSensorIndex` variable and look up its description using the `spSensorDescription` variable.
5. Review the sensor's configuration and settings to ensure they are correct.
6. Check the system or component being monitored by the sensor for any signs of malfunction or anomaly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold.
2. Take corrective action to address the issue, such as adjusting system settings, replacing components, or performing maintenance tasks.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal range.
4. Update the sensor configuration and settings as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Monitor the sensor and system for any further anomalies or issues.
6. Consider implementing proactive measures to prevent similar issues from occurring, such as implementing predictive maintenance or upgrading system components.
