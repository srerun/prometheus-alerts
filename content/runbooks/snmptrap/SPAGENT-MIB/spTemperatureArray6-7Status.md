# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-7Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-7Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold. This trap is sent by the agent to notify the network management system of a potential issue with the temperature sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as it may indicate a potential overheating issue with the device or system being monitored. If left unchecked, this could lead to damage to the device, system failure, or even a fire. Prompt attention is required to investigate and mitigate the issue.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the affected sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor value**: Use the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading of the sensor.
3. **Determine the threshold level**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold level that was exceeded.
4. **Verify the sensor status**: Use the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
5. **Review sensor description**: Use the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context and location of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the cause**: Determine the root cause of the temperature increase, such as a faulty cooling system, blocked air vents, or high ambient temperature.
2. **Take corrective action**: Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the temperature increase, such as repairing or replacing the cooling system, clearing blocked air vents, or relocating the device to a cooler environment.
3. **Monitor the sensor**: Continue to monitor the temperature sensor to ensure that the issue has been resolved and the temperature has returned to a safe range.
4. **Update documentation**: Update documentation to reflect the changes made to resolve the issue, including any modifications to the cooling system or sensor configuration.
5. **Notify stakeholders**: Notify stakeholders of the issue and the steps taken to resolve it, including any changes to the device or system configuration.
