# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch60Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alarm. The trap provides detailed information about the sensor, including its status, value, and the threshold that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that a switch sensor has reported an abnormal reading, which could indicate a potential issue with the switch or its environment. This could lead to equipment failure, network downtime, or other performance issues if left unaddressed.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` with the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Review the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the purpose and behavior of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold. This may involve reviewing switch logs, environmental monitoring systems, or other related data.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting the switch's configuration, replacing a faulty component, or improving the environmental conditions.
3. Clear the alarm once the issue has been resolved and the sensor reading has returned to a normal state.
4. Update the sensor thresholds or configure alerting rules to prevent similar false positives or unnecessary alarms in the future.
