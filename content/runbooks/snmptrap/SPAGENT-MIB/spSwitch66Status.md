# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch66Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch66Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a certain level, triggering an alarm. This trap is sent when a sensor on a switch reports a value that exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch sensor has detected an abnormal condition, which may indicate a hardware or environmental issue. If left unaddressed, this could lead to device failure, data loss, or even physical damage to the switch or surrounding equipment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor status (`spSensorStatus`) to determine the current state of the sensor.
2. Verify the sensor value (`spSensorValue`) to understand the current reading.
3. Check the level that was exceeded (`spSensorLevelExceeded`) to determine the threshold that was breached.
4. Identify the sensor index (`spSensorIndex`) and name (`spSensorName`) to determine which sensor is affected.
5. Review the sensor description (`spSensorDescription`) to understand the purpose and function of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the sensor reading (`spSensorValue`) to determine the cause of the alarm (e.g., temperature, voltage, fan speed, etc.).
2. Check the switch's environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, airflow, etc.) to ensure they are within acceptable ranges.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and not faulty.
4. Take corrective action to address the root cause of the alarm (e.g., replace a faulty fan, clean dust from the switch, etc.).
5. Clear the alarm once the issue has been resolved and the sensor reading has returned to a normal state.

Remember to document the steps taken to resolve the issue and update any relevant monitoring and maintenance procedures to prevent similar issues in the future.
