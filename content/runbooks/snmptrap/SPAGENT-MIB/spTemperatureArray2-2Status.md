Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray2-2Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a critical threshold.

## Impact

This trap can indicate a potential overheating issue in the system, which can lead to:

* System failure or shutdown
* Data loss or corruption
* Equipment damage
* Downtime and lost productivity

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Verify the `spSensorIndex` variable to ensure it matches the expected sensor index.
5. Check the system logs for any related error messages or issues.
6. Physically inspect the system to ensure proper airflow, cooling, and temperature control.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the cause of the overheating issue and take corrective action.
2. Check the system's cooling system and ensure it is functioning properly.
3. Verify that the system's temperature sensors are accurately reporting temperature readings.
4. Consider implementing additional cooling measures, such as installing additional fans or replacing components.
5. Monitor the temperature sensor readings closely to ensure the issue does not recur.
6. Update the system's configuration to alert administrators of temperature threshold exceedances.
7. Consider scheduling a maintenance window to perform further troubleshooting and repairs.
