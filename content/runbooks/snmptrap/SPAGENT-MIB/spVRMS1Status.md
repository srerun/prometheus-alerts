# SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS1Status 

VRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS1Status trap indicates that a VRMS (Voltage Regulator Module) sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alarm. This trap is sent by the device to notify administrators of a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate a potential problem with the power supply or voltage regulation system, which could lead to:

* System instability or crashes
* Data loss or corruption
* Hardware damage or failure
* Increased temperature or power consumption

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor by checking the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the threshold value that was exceeded by referencing the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Verify the status of the sensor by checking the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. Check the system logs for any related errors or warnings.
6. Perform a visual inspection of the VRMS module and surrounding components.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. If the sensor value indicates a critical level, consider shutting down the system to prevent further damage.
2. Check the VRMS module and surrounding components for signs of physical damage or wear.
3. Verify that the system is properly ventilated and that the environment is within recommended operating temperatures.
4. Adjust the threshold value for the sensor to prevent false alarms.
5. Consider replacing the VRMS module or sensor if it is found to be faulty.
6. Perform a thorough system diagnostic to ensure that there are no other underlying issues.

Note: The specific mitigation steps may vary depending on the specific system and environment. It is essential to follow established procedures and consult with subject matter experts as needed.
