# SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMSStatus 

VRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMSStatus trap indicates that a Voltage Regulator Module (VRM) sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. The trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, a VRM sensor alert can indicate a potential issue with the power supply or voltage regulation in the system, which can lead to equipment failure or data loss if left unaddressed.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the sensor and the threshold that was exceeded.
6. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold, such as a power supply issue or a fault in the voltage regulation system.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying cause, such as replacing a faulty power supply or adjusting the voltage regulation settings.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range and that the system is functioning correctly.
4. Update the sensor threshold or alert settings as needed to prevent future false positives or to improve the accuracy of the alerts.
5. Document the incident and the corrective actions taken to improve future diagnosis and mitigation.
