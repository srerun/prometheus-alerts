  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch19Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch19Status` SNMP trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering a notification to the network management system. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the trap, including its status, value, and description.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that it may indicate a potential issue with the switch, such as overheating, power supply failure, or fan failure. If left unaddressed, this issue could lead to switch failure, network downtime, and ultimately, business disruption.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor that exceeded the threshold.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
4. Check the `spSensorIndex` variable to determine the index of the sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine the type of sensor and its description.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, to ensure they are within recommended specifications.
2. Check the switch's power supply and fan status to ensure they are functioning properly.
3. Check the switch's event logs for any other error messages or alarms that may be related to the sensor issue.
4. Perform any necessary remedial actions, such as replacing a failed fan or power supply unit, or adjusting the switch's environmental conditions.
5. Once the issue has been resolved, clear the sensor alarm by resetting the `spSensorStatus` variable to a normal state.
6. Monitor the switch's sensors and logs for any further issues or alarms.
