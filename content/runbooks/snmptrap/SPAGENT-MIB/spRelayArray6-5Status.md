# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-5Status 

RelayArray6.5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-5Status` trap indicates that a sensor in Relay Array 6 has exceeded a specified threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that has been exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Overheating or temperature fluctuations in the relay array
* Electrical or mechanical issues with the relay array
* Disruption to normal operation of the relay array
* Potential for equipment damage or failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Check the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine the name and description of the sensor.
6. Review recent logs and monitoring data to identify any patterns or trends that may indicate the cause of the issue.
7. Perform visual inspections and diagnostic tests on the relay array to identify any physical issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying issue causing the sensor to exceed the threshold (e.g. adjust cooling systems, repair or replace faulty components, etc.).
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and accurately reporting its status.
3. Adjust the threshold level for the sensor if necessary to prevent future false alarms.
4. Implement additional monitoring and logging to track the sensor's status and identify potential issues before they become critical.
5. Consider scheduling maintenance or repair of the relay array to prevent future issues.
