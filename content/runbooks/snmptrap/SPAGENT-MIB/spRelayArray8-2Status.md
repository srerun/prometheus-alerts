RelayArray8.2 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-2Status trap indicates that a sensor has exceeded a certain level and triggered an alert. This trap is specific to the RelayArray8.2 sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and the level that was exceeded. Potential impacts include:

* System downtime or instability
* Data loss or corruption
* Security breaches
* Performance degradation

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status of the sensor by checking the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Review the sensor value that exceeded the level by checking the `spSensorValue` and `spSensorLevelExceeded` variables.
4. Review the sensor description to understand the context of the sensor and the level that was exceeded.
5. Check system logs for any related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Take immediate action to address the sensor issue, such as replacing a faulty sensor or adjusting the sensor configuration.
2. Review system configuration and adjust thresholds to prevent future sensor level exceedances.
3. Implement monitoring and alerting to catch similar issues before they become critical.
4. Perform root cause analysis to identify the underlying cause of the sensor level exceedance and implement corrective actions.
5. Verify that the issue is resolved by checking the sensor status and value.
