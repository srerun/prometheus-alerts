sensorProbe sensor status went to Critical 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The sensorProbe sensor status has gone Critical, indicating a severe issue with the sensor that requires immediate attention.

## Impact

* The critical status of the sensor may indicate a hardware failure or a severe environmental condition that can impact the overall system reliability and availability.
* Depending on the sensor type and location, this critical status may affect the safety and integrity of the system, people, or the environment.

## Diagnosis

* Check the sensor name and description (spSensorName and spSensorDescription) to determine the type and location of the affected sensor.
* Verify the current sensor value (spSensorValue) and the level that was exceeded (spSensorLevelExceeded) to understand the severity of the issue.
* Check the sensor index (spSensorIndex) to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
* Review the sensor status (spSensorStatus) to confirm that it is indeed in a Critical state.
* Check the system logs and monitoring tools for any additional error messages or alerts related to the sensor or system.

## Mitigation

* Immediately investigate the cause of the critical sensor status and take corrective action to address the underlying issue.
* If the sensor is reporting an environmental condition, take necessary steps to maintain a safe and healthy environment.
* If the sensor is reporting a hardware failure, replace or repair the faulty component as soon as possible.
* Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated to ensure accurate readings.
* Once the issue is resolved, clear the sensor status and verify that it returns to a normal state.
* Update the incident management system with the root cause and resolution of the issue to improve future incident response.
