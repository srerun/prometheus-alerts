# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-8Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-8Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact

* The system may be experiencing a thermal issue that could lead to hardware failure or degradation if not addressed.
* If left unmitigated, the elevated temperature could cause downtime, data loss, or system instability.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Consult system logs and monitoring tools to gather more information about the temperature trends and system performance.

## Mitigation

1. Identify the root cause of the elevated temperature, such as a malfunctioning cooling system, blocked air vents, or high ambient temperature.
2. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as:
	* Turning off non-essential systems or components to reduce heat generation.
	* Improving airflow around the system by clearing blockages or rearranging equipment.
	* Initiating a controlled shutdown or powering off the system if the temperature continues to rise.
3. Schedule a maintenance window to perform a thorough inspection and repair or replace faulty components.
4. Implement preventive measures to avoid similar issues in the future, such as:
	* Regularly cleaning dust from system components and air vents.
	* Ensuring proper airflow and cooling system function.
	* Implementing temperature monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect potential issues before they become critical.
