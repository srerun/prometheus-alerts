# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch13Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch13Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alarm. This trap is sent by the switch to notify the network management system of the sensor status.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch's sensor has reached a critical level, which may affect the switch's performance, availability, or reliability. Failure to address this issue may lead to switch downtime, data loss, or security breaches.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current value of the sensor.
4. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Verify the `spSensorIndex` variable to ensure the correct sensor is being monitored.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the switch's sensor configuration to ensure it is correctly set up and calibrated.
2. Verify that the threshold values are properly configured and adjusted according to the switch's operating environment.
3. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue causing the sensor to exceed the threshold (e.g., fan failure, temperature rise, or power supply issues).
4. Clear the trap after resolving the issue to prevent further notifications.
5. Monitor the switch's sensor values to ensure the issue is resolved and the sensor returns to a normal operating range.
