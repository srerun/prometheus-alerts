# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray2-5Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap:

**Temperature Sensor Trap**

## Meaning

This trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold value, triggering an alert. The trap is sent by the SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray2-5Status OID.

## Impact

* A temperature sensor has exceeded a critical threshold, potentially indicating an environmental issue that could impact the normal operation of the device or system.
* This could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or other unexpected behavior.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the affected sensor using the **spSensorIndex** and **spSensorName** variables.
2. Check the current **spSensorValue** to determine the temperature reading that triggered the trap.
3. Verify the **spSensorLevelExceeded** value to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Consult the **spSensorDescription** for more information about the sensor and its location.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any other related issues or anomalies.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the physical environment to ensure that the temperature is within the recommended operating range.
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and providing accurate readings.
3. If the temperature is high, investigate and address any potential causes, such as cooling system failures or blockages.
4. Consider adjusting the temperature threshold settings to prevent future false positives.
5. If the issue persists, consider contacting support or replacing the sensor if necessary.

By following these steps, you can quickly identify and address the underlying cause of the temperature sensor trap, minimizing the impact on system operation and reliability.
