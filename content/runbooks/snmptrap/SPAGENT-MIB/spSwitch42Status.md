# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch42Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch42Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold value, triggering an alert to the network management system. This trap provides information about the sensor's current status, value, and the level that was exceeded, as well as the sensor's index, name, and description.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch sensor has reported an abnormal condition that may indicate a problem with the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, or power supply. This could potentially lead to equipment failure, downtime, or data loss if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by referencing the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Consult the switch's documentation and sensor descriptions to understand the implications of the sensor's readings.
6. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and is not experiencing any faults.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and resolve the underlying cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold value.
2. Take corrective action to return the sensor reading to a safe operating range.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and is not experiencing any faults.
4. If the issue persists, consider relocating the sensor or adjusting the threshold value to prevent future false alarms.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it in the network management system's trouble ticketing system.
