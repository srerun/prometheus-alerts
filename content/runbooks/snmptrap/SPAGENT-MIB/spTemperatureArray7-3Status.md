# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-3Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-3Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-3Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has detected an out-of-range value. This trap is sent when the sensor reading exceeds a predetermined threshold.

## Impact

This trap has a medium to high impact on system availability and reliability. If a temperature sensor is reporting an out-of-range value, it may indicate a potential overheating issue that could lead to system crashes, slow performance, or even hardware failure.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose this issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the location and purpose of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and is not reporting a false alarm.

## Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the temperature excursion, such as a malfunctioning fan or a blocked air vent.
2. Take immediate action to address the overheating issue, such as reducing system load or implementing cooling measures.
3. Verify that the temperature sensor is functioning correctly and adjust the threshold value if necessary.
4. Monitor the temperature sensor closely to ensure that the issue is resolved and does not recur.
5. Consider implementing proactive measures to prevent future overheating issues, such as scheduled maintenance or environmental monitoring.
