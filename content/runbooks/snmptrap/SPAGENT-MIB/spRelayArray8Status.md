# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8Status 

RelayArray8 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8Status trap indicates that a relay array sensor has exceeded a configured threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent by the agent monitoring the sensor and provides information about the sensor's status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the relay array sensor has detected an abnormal condition, which may indicate a fault or anomaly in the system. This could lead to system downtime, data loss, or other unforeseen consequences if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Determine the sensor value**: Use the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. **Check the threshold**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. **Verify the sensor status**: Use the `spSensorStatus` variable to verify the current status of the sensor.
5. **Review sensor description**: Use the `spSensorDescription` variable to review the description of the sensor and understand its purpose.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the cause**: Investigate the reason for the sensor exceeding the threshold. This may involve reviewing system logs, monitoring system performance, or consulting with system administrators.
2. **Take corrective action**: Take corrective action to address the underlying cause of the issue. This may involve adjusting system settings, replacing faulty components, or performing maintenance tasks.
3. **Verify sensor status**: Verify that the sensor status has returned to normal after taking corrective action.
4. **Update threshold settings**: Consider updating the threshold settings for the sensor to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. **Document the incident**: Document the incident, including the cause, corrective action taken, and any updates made to threshold settings.
