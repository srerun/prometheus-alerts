# SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual9Status 

Virtual9 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual9Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual9Status` trap is generated when a virtual9 sensor reports a status change. This trap is specific to the virtual9 sensor and is sent when the sensor's status exceeds a predetermined threshold. The trap provides information about the sensor, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, this trap may indicate a potential issue with the sensor or the system being monitored. For example, if the virtual9 sensor is monitoring temperature, the trap may indicate that the temperature has exceeded a safe or recommended level.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Check the `spSensorIndex` variable to determine the index of the sensor.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine the name and description of the sensor.
6. Analyze the sensor data to determine the cause of the threshold exceedance.
7. Check the system logs for any related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the threshold exceedance and take corrective action.
2. Check the sensor configuration to ensure it is properly set up and calibrated.
3. Verify that the system is functioning correctly and that there are no other related issues.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent false positives.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it.
6. Consider implementing additional monitoring or alerts to prevent similar issues in the future.
