# SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS2Status 

VRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS2Status trap indicates that a Virtual Remote Monitoring System (VRMS) sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold value, triggering this trap to be sent. The trap provides detailed information about the sensor, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

* Potential impact on system performance or availability
* Alerting operations team to investigate and take corrective action
* Possible indication of hardware or environmental issues

## Diagnosis

* Review the spSensorStatus variable to determine the current status of the sensor (e.g., normal, warning, critical)
* Examine the spSensorValue variable to determine the current reading of the sensor
* Check the spSensorLevelExceeded variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded
* Use the spSensorIndex variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap
* Refer to the spSensorName and spSensorDescription variables for additional context about the sensor

## Mitigation

* Investigate the sensor and its environment to determine the root cause of the issue
* Take corrective action to address the underlying issue (e.g., adjust environmental settings, replace faulty hardware)
* Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and within normal operating ranges
* Consider adjusting the threshold values for the sensor to prevent future false positives or false negatives
* Update monitoring tools and procedures to ensure that similar issues are detected and addressed promptly in the future
