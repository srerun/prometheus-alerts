  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-1Status trap is generated when a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential environmental issue that may impact system performance or reliability.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, which may indicate a potential environmental issue that can cause system downtime, data loss, or equipment damage. If left unaddressed, this issue can lead to reduced system performance, increased downtime, and potential hardware failures.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor index (spSensorIndex) to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Verify the sensor name (spSensorName) and description (spSensorDescription) to determine the location and type of sensor that is reporting an excessive temperature.
3. Check the sensor status (spSensorStatus) to determine if the sensor is reporting an error or if the temperature reading is valid.
4. Review the sensor value (spSensorValue) to determine the current temperature reading and compare it to the threshold level (spSensorLevelExceeded) to understand the extent of the issue.
5. Check the system logs for any related errors or warnings that may indicate the root cause of the temperature increase.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the temperature increase, such as a faulty cooling system, blocked air vents, or high ambient temperature.
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause, such as repairing or replacing the cooling system, cleaning the air vents, or relocating the equipment to a cooler environment.
3. Verify that the temperature sensor is functioning correctly and that the readings are accurate.
4. Adjust the temperature threshold levels (spSensorLevelExceeded) as necessary to ensure that the system is alerted to potential issues before they become critical.
5. Monitor the system closely to ensure that the issue has been resolved and that the temperature readings have returned to normal.
