# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-2Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning
This SNMP Trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert to be sent. The trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact
The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the environment in which it is deployed. However, in general, it can indicate a potential issue with the temperature of a device or system, which can lead to equipment failure, data loss, or other problems if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` value to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Consult the sensor's documentation and the system's monitoring configuration to understand the normal operating range and any specific alerting thresholds.
5. If necessary, perform additional troubleshooting steps to determine the root cause of the temperature issue, such as checking for hardware faults, software configuration issues, or environmental factors.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately acknowledge the trap and note the sensor's current status and value.
2. If the temperature reading is excessively high or low, take immediate action to prevent damage to the device or system, such as shutting down the system or taking cooling/heating measures.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
4. If the issue is caused by a hardware fault, replace the faulty component or schedule maintenance as soon as possible.
5. Adjust the sensor's threshold or alerting configuration as necessary to prevent future false positives or to improve the system's overall monitoring and alerting capabilities.
