# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray8-5Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray8-5Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides critical information about the sensor, including its status, value, level exceeded, index, name, and description.

## Impact

If this trap is not addressed promptly, it could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or even physical damage to the surrounding environment. Elevated temperatures can cause hardware components to malfunction or fail, resulting in system downtime and potential data loss. In extreme cases, high temperatures can also pose a fire hazard.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by consulting the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Determine the current temperature value from the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to understand the current status of the sensor.
4. Verify the threshold level that was exceeded by referencing the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the location and purpose of the temperature sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the temperature sensor to determine the cause of the elevated temperature.
2. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as adjusting cooling systems, cleaning air vents, or relocating equipment.
3. Verify that the temperature has returned to a safe range by monitoring the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Consider implementing additional monitoring or alerting mechanisms to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Update any relevant documentation or knowledge bases to reflect the corrective actions taken and any changes made to the system.
