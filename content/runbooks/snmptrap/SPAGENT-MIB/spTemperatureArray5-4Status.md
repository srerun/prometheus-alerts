# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-4Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-4Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold. This trap is sent by the device when the temperature sensor reaches a level that requires attention.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential thermal issue with the device or its surrounding environment. If left unchecked, high temperatures can lead to device failure, data loss, or even physical damage. Prompt attention to this issue is necessary to prevent downtime and maintain system reliability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value reported by the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the device's documentation and sensor descriptions (available in `spSensorDescription`) to understand the normal operating temperature range for the device.
5. Verify the device's environmental conditions, such as airflow, cooling, and ambient temperature.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature of the device, such as:
	* Improving airflow around the device.
	* Ensuring proper cooling system operation.
	* Reducing the device's power consumption or load.
2. Verify that the temperature sensor is functioning correctly and accurately reporting temperatures.
3. Adjust the temperature threshold settings for the sensor, if necessary, to prevent future false positives.
4. Monitor the device's temperature and system performance to ensure the issue is fully resolved.
5. Consider scheduling a maintenance window to perform preventative maintenance tasks, such as cleaning the device or replacing worn-out components.
