Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch50Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch50Status` trap is generated when a switch sensor reports a status change. This trap is sent by the switch to notify the network management system of a potential issue with one of its sensors.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, this trap may indicate a hardware or environmental issue with the switch that could potentially affect network availability or performance.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the sensor and the potential impact of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor status change, such as a hardware failure or environmental issue.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as replacing a failed component or adjusting the switch's environmental settings.
3. Monitor the sensor to ensure that the issue has been resolved and that the sensor is reporting a normal status.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold settings for the sensor to prevent future false alarms or to improve the detection of real issues.
