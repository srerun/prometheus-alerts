# SPAGENT-MIB::spDownStatus 

sensorProbe status went to Disabled 



Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spDownStatus` trap indicates that the SensorProbe agent has changed its status to "Disabled". This means that the SensorProbe device, which is responsible for monitoring environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, and power usage, is no longer operational or reporting data.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the monitoring system will no longer receive updates on environmental conditions from the affected SensorProbe device. This can lead to a lack of visibility into potential issues, such as:

* Un-detected temperature or humidity deviations that can affect server or data center operations
* Un-detected power outages or voltage fluctuations that can impact equipment availability
* Delayed or missed notifications of potential issues, which can lead to extended downtime or system failures

In addition, this can also lead to compliance and regulatory issues, as well as increased risk of equipment failure or damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the `SPAGENT-MIB::spDownStatus` trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the SensorProbe device's power status to ensure it is properly powered on.
2. Verify that the device is properly connected to the network and configured correctly.
3. Review system logs and event logs for any error messages or indications of issues that may have caused the device to become disabled.
4. Check the SensorProbe agent software version and configuration to ensure they are up-to-date and correct.
5. Perform a restart of the SensorProbe device and verify that it comes back online and begins reporting data again.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of the `SPAGENT-MIB::spDownStatus` trap, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate and diagnose the root cause of the issue to prevent further downtime.
2. Perform a restart of the SensorProbe device, if necessary, to restore monitoring capabilities.
3. Verify that the device is properly configured and reporting data correctly after the restart.
4. Consider implementing redundancy or backup monitoring solutions to ensure continuous monitoring of environmental conditions.
5. Review and update maintenance schedules and procedures to ensure regular checks and maintenance of SensorProbe devices to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
