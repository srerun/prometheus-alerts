# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3Status 

RelayArray3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3Status` SNMP trap is generated when a sensor thresholds are exceeded on the RelayArray3 sensor. This trap indicates that a specific sensor has exceeded a pre-defined threshold, triggering the trap to be sent.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that it may indicate a potential environmental issue, such as high temperature, humidity, or other factors that could affect the operation or reliability of the system. If left unchecked, this could lead to system downtime, data loss, or equipment failure.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Check the sensor status**: Examine the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. **Verify the sensor value**: Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. **Identify the exceeded level**: Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. **Identify the affected sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. **Investigate the environmental conditions**: Check the environmental conditions around the sensor to determine if there are any issues that could be contributing to the exceeded threshold.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate and address the root cause**: Identify and address the underlying environmental issue that triggered the trap.
2. **Adjust the sensor threshold**: Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent future traps from being generated.
3. **Notify relevant personnel**: Inform relevant personnel of the issue and the actions taken to resolve it.
4. **Monitor the sensor**: Continuously monitor the sensor to ensure that the issue has been resolved and does not recur.
5. **Update the sensor configuration**: Update the sensor configuration as necessary to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
