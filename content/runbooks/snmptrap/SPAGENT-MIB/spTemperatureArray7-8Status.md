# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-8Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-8Status` SNMP trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a certain threshold, triggering a warning or alert condition. This trap is sent by the SP Agent and provides information about the sensor that caused the trap to be sent.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential environmental issue affecting the device or system being monitored. High temperatures can lead to equipment failure, downtime, and data loss. Ignoring this trap may result in further damage or operational disruptions.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the affected sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor value**: Use the `spSensorValue` variable to check the current temperature reading of the affected sensor.
3. **Determine the exceeded level**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded, triggering the trap.
4. **Verify sensor status**: Use the `spSensorStatus` variable to verify the current status of the affected sensor.
5. **Consult sensor description**: Use the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the purpose and location of the affected sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate environmental conditions**: Check the environmental conditions surrounding the device or system to identify the cause of the high temperature.
2. **Verify cooling system operation**: Ensure that the cooling system is functioning correctly and adjust or repair it as needed.
3. **Take corrective action**: Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as relocating the device, improving airflow, or replacing faulty components.
4. **Monitor sensor readings**: Continuously monitor the temperature sensor readings to ensure the issue is resolved and does not reoccur.
5. **Update sensor configuration**: If necessary, update the sensor configuration to adjust the threshold value or modify the alert settings to prevent false positives or negatives.
