### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is the runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6Status` trap indicates that a sensor threshold has been exceeded on a RelayArray6 sensor. This trap is sent when the sensor value crosses a predetermined level, indicating a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that has been exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Decreased system performance
* Increased risk of system downtime
* Potential data loss or corruption

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Determine the current sensor value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the purpose and function of the sensor.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify any other related issues or trends.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor threshold being exceeded.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting system settings or replacing faulty equipment.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range.
4. Update the sensor threshold if necessary to prevent future occurrences of this trap.
5. Monitor the system for any further issues or anomalies.
