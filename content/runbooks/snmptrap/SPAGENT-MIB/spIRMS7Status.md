# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS7Status 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS7Status SNMP trap indicates that an IRMS (Intelligent Remote Management System) sensor has reached a critical level, triggering an alert. This trap is sent when a sensor reading exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that have been exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Environmental issues (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.)
* Power or cooling system failure
* Security breaches
* Disruption of critical services or applications

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` to understand the purpose and context of the sensor.
5. Verify the status of the sensor by checking the `spSensorStatus` variable.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue (e.g., repair or replace equipment, adjust environmental settings, etc.).
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a safe level.
4. Check the sensor status to ensure it is functioning correctly.
5. Consider adjusting the threshold level or sensor settings to prevent future false positives or to improve sensitivity.
6. Document the incident and the actions taken to resolve it.
