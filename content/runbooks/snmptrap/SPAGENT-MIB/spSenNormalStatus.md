sensorProbe sensor status is Normal 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSenNormalStatus` trap is sent when a sensor's status returns to normal. This trap is generated when a sensor's value falls within a normal range after previously exceeding a threshold.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as it indicates a return to normal operating conditions for the sensor. However, it may be useful for tracking and monitoring sensor performance and availability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Review the sensor's current value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the sensor's normal operating range to ensure it is within expected limits.
4. Verify that the sensor's status is indeed normal using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. If the sensor's status is normal, no further action may be required. However, it is recommended to continue monitoring the sensor to ensure it remains within normal operating conditions.

## Mitigation

No mitigation is typically required for this trap, as it indicates a return to normal operating conditions for the sensor. However, consider the following:

1. Verify that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated to ensure accurate readings.
2. Review sensor thresholds and adjust as necessary to prevent false or nuisance alarms.
3. Continue to monitor sensor performance and adjust maintenance schedules as needed.
4. If the sensor's status frequently transitions between normal and abnormal states, consider investigating the root cause of the issue to prevent future occurrences.
