# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-5Status 

RelayArray8.5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-5Status trap indicates that a sensor in the RelayArray8.5 has exceeded a threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate a potential issue with the RelayArray8.5 or its environment that requires attention. Ignoring this trap could lead to system downtime, data loss, or other negative consequences.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables to determine the current state of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the sensor reading.
5. Verify that the RelayArray8.5 is functioning correctly and that there are no other issues that may be contributing to the sensor reading.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the issue indicated by the sensor reading.
2. Check the RelayArray8.5 for any signs of hardware or software failure.
3. Verify that the sensor is calibrated and functioning correctly.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold levels for the sensor to prevent future traps.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference.
