# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-2Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-2Status` SNMP trap is triggered when a temperature sensor exceeds a predefined threshold. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential environmental issue that may impact device operation or reliability.

## Impact

* High temperature levels can cause device malfunction or failure, leading to downtime and data loss.
* Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can reduce the lifespan of devices and components.
* Ignoring temperature-related issues can lead to more severe problems, such as hardware damage or even fire hazards.

## Diagnosis

* Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
* Verify the `spSensorStatus` variable to confirm the sensor status (e.g., normal, warning, critical).
* Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded.
* Identify the specific sensor causing the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
* Check device logs and monitoring systems for any related errors or warnings.

## Mitigation

* Investigate the root cause of the high temperature reading (e.g., cooling system failure, blocked air vents, high ambient temperature).
* Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as:
	+ Verifying proper airflow and ventilation around the device.
	+ Ensuring that cooling systems are functioning correctly.
	+ Implementing temporary cooling measures, like fans or air conditioning.
* Consider relocating the device to a cooler environment or providing additional cooling solutions.
* Update device configurations or threshold settings to prevent future occurrences.
* Schedule maintenance or repairs to prevent similar issues in the future.
