# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-2Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-2Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent by a network device, such as a switch or router, to notify administrators of a potential issue with the device's temperature.

## Impact

If left unaddressed, high temperatures can cause device failure, leading to network downtime, data loss, and decreased productivity. In extreme cases, it can also lead to physical damage to the device or surrounding equipment.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Check the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine the location and type of sensor that triggered the trap.
6. Verify the temperature reading by checking other temperature sensors on the device, if available.
7. Check the device's event logs for any other related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the device's cooling system is functioning properly.
2. Check for any blockages or obstructions in the airflow around the device.
3. Ensure that the device is installed in a well-ventilated area.
4. Check the temperature of the surrounding environment to ensure it is within a safe range.
5. Consider increasing the cooling capacity of the device or its enclosure.
6. If the issue persists, consider replacing the device or seeking assistance from the manufacturer or a professional services organization.
