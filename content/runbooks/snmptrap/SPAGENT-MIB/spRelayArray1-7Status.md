# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-7Status 

RelayArray1.7 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray1-7Status trap indicates that a sensor in Relay Array 1, specifically sensor 7, has triggered an event that requires attention. The sensor status has exceeded a certain level, causing this trap to be sent.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the level that was exceeded. However, in general, this trap may indicate a potential issue with the environment or equipment being monitored, such as high temperature, humidity, or other environmental factors. If left unchecked, this could lead to equipment failure, downtime, or data loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, refer to the trap variables provided:

* `spSensorStatus`: Check the current integer status of the sensor to determine the severity of the issue.
* `spSensorValue`: Review the current integer value of the sensor to understand the current reading.
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: Identify the integer level that was exceeded, which triggered the trap.
* `spSensorIndex`: Note the integer index of the sensor causing the trap.
* `spSensorName`: Check the name of the sensor to understand what is being monitored.
* `spSensorDescription`: Review the description of the sensor to gain context on what the sensor is monitoring.

Use this information to:

* Check the sensor reading and determine if it is within normal operating ranges.
* Investigate the environment and equipment being monitored to identify the root cause of the issue.
* Consult with relevant teams or experts to diagnose the issue.

## Mitigation

Based on the diagnosis, take the following mitigation steps:

* If the sensor reading is outside of normal operating ranges, take corrective action to bring the reading back within range.
* If the issue is related to environmental factors, take steps to address the environment, such as adjusting temperature or humidity controls.
* If the issue is related to equipment malfunction, perform necessary maintenance or repairs to resolve the issue.
* Consider adjusting the sensor thresholds or sensitivity to prevent future false positives or minimize the impact of future events.

Remember to update the sensor configuration and monitoring tools as necessary to reflect the changes made during mitigation.
