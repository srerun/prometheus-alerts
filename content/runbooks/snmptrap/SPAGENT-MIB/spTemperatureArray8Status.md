# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray8Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray8Status trap is generated when a temperature sensor exceeds a configured threshold. This trap indicates that a temperature sensor has reached a critical level, potentially impacting system operation or reliability.

## Impact

* System downtime or crashes due to overheating components
* Reduced system performance or instability
* Potential damage to hardware components
* Increased risk of system failure or data loss

## Diagnosis

1. Identify the affected sensor: Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to determine which temperature sensor triggered the trap.
2. Determine the severity of the issue: Evaluate the `spSensorValue` and `spSensorLevelExceeded` variables to understand the current temperature reading and the threshold that was exceeded.
3. Check system logs: Review system logs for any related error messages or system events that may indicate the root cause of the temperature issue.
4. Verify sensor accuracy: Check the sensor's calibration and accuracy to ensure that the reading is reliable.

## Mitigation

1. Take immediate action: Immediately address the temperature issue to prevent system damage or downtime.
2. Identify root cause: Determine the underlying cause of the temperature increase, such as a faulty fan or blocked air vent.
3. Take corrective action: Implement a solution to correct the root cause, such as replacing a faulty fan or cleaning the air vent.
4. Monitor system temperature: Closely monitor the system temperature to ensure that the issue is resolved and does not recur.
5. Update sensor configuration: If necessary, adjust the sensor configuration to prevent false alarms or optimize temperature monitoring.
