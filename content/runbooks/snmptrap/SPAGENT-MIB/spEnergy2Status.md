# SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy2Status 

Energy sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy2Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy2Status` trap is generated when an energy sensor reports a status change or exceeds a defined threshold. This trap is sent by the energy sensor to notify administrators of potential issues related to power consumption or energy usage.

## Impact

The impact of this trap varies depending on the specific energy sensor and the threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Increased energy costs due to excessive power consumption
* Reduced system reliability or availability due to overloading or overheating
* Potential environmental impacts from increased energy usage
* Inefficient use of resources, leading to wasted energy and money

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, check the following variables:

* `spSensorStatus`: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent
* `spSensorValue`: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent
* `spSensorIndex`: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent
* `spSensorName`: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent
* `spSensorDescription`: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent

Use this information to identify the specific energy sensor and threshold exceeded, and to determine the severity of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Investigate the energy sensor and the system it is monitoring to determine the cause of the status change or threshold exceedance.
2. Verify that the energy sensor is properly configured and calibrated.
3. Check the system's power consumption and adjust it if necessary to prevent overloading or overheating.
4. Consider implementing energy-efficient measures, such as reducing power consumption during off-peak hours or using power-saving features.
5. Monitor the energy sensor and system for further issues and adjust thresholds as needed to prevent future notifications.
6. Consider escalating the issue to a higher-level team or manager if the problem persists or has significant impact on system reliability or energy costs.
