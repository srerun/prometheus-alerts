RelayArray5.5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-5Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-5Status` trap is triggered when a sensor on the RelayArray5.5 device exceeds a predetermined level. This trap is sent to alert administrators of a potential issue with the device.

## Impact

The impact of this trap varies depending on the sensor and the threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Service disruption or degradation
* Increased risk of data loss or corruption
* Reduced system availability or reliability

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Check the `spSensorIndex` variable to determine the index of the sensor.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the sensor and its purpose.

Using this information, investigate the device and the sensor to determine the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the issue, such as restarting the device or replacing the sensor.
2. Review system logs and sensor data to determine the root cause of the issue.
3. Adjust the threshold levels for the sensor to prevent future false positives.
4. Perform maintenance on the device to ensure it is functioning properly.
5. Consider implementing additional monitoring or alerting to prevent similar issues in the future.

Note: The specific mitigation steps will vary depending on the device, sensor, and system configuration. These steps are general guidelines and may need to be adapted to the specific situation.
