# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS4Status 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS4Status trap is generated when an IRMS sensor reports an event that exceeds a pre-configured threshold. This trap is sent to alert administrators of potential environmental issues that may impact system operation or safety.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Overheating: If the sensor is measuring temperature, the system may be at risk of overheating, which can lead to component failure or damage.
* Humidity issues: If the sensor is measuring humidity, the system may be at risk of water damage or corrosion.
* Power issues: If the sensor is measuring power consumption, the system may be at risk of power overload or outage.
* System downtime: In severe cases, the system may shut down or become unavailable to prevent damage or ensure safety.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor index and name using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current sensor value and threshold level exceeded using the `spSensorValue` and `spSensorLevelExceeded` variables.
3. Check the sensor description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the specific environmental condition being monitored.
4. Review system logs and other monitoring data to identify any correlated events or trends.
5. Physically inspect the environment and system to identify any obvious issues or hazards.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the environmental condition that triggered the trap (e.g., adjust cooling, humidity control, or power management systems).
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
3. Check for any software or firmware updates that may be related to the sensor or system monitoring.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level to prevent false positives or to increase sensitivity to environmental changes.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to mitigate the issue to improve future response and prevention.
