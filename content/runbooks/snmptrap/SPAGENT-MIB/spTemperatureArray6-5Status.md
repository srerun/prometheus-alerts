  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is the runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-5Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-5Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent by a device to notify administrators of a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as high temperatures can cause damage to devices or equipment, leading to downtime, data loss, and potential safety risks. Ignoring this trap can result in further complications or even system failures.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current temperature reading.
3. Compare the `spSensorValue` with the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was breached.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the high temperature reading, such as a malfunctioning cooling system or a blocked air vent.
2. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as shutting down non-essential systems or activating backup cooling systems.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
4. Adjust the temperature threshold settings if necessary to prevent future false alerts.
5. Schedule maintenance or repair to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
