# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch58Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap is generated when a switch sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential issue with the switch's environmental conditions.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as it may indicate overheating, overvoltage, or other environmental factors that can cause the switch to malfunction or fail. If left unaddressed, it can lead to network downtime, data loss, or even damage to the switch itself.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Review the switch's logs and monitoring data to see if there are any other related issues or errors.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance.
2. Take corrective action to address the environmental issue, such as adjusting the temperature or voltage settings.
3. Verify that the switch is functioning normally and that there are no other related issues.
4. If necessary, consider relocating the switch to a more suitable environment or implementing additional cooling or voltage regulation measures.
5. Update the switch's monitoring settings and thresholds as needed to prevent similar issues in the future.
