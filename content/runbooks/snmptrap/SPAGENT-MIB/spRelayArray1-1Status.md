  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap is generated when the RelayArray1.1 sensor reaches a critical status, indicating a potential issue with the sensor or the component it is monitoring. This trap provides critical information about the sensor status, value, and level exceeded, allowing for swift diagnosis and mitigation of the issue.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is high, as it may indicate a failure or malfunction of the sensor or the component it is monitoring. If left unattended, this could lead to equipment downtime, data loss, or even safety risks. Prompt diagnosis and mitigation are essential to minimize the impact and prevent further damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check sensor status**: Use the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. **Review sensor value**: Use the `spSensorValue` variable to review the current value of the sensor.
4. **Determine level exceeded**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded, causing the trap to be sent.
5. **Consult sensor documentation**: Use the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to consult the sensor documentation and understand the implications of the trap.
6. **Perform visual inspection**: Perform a visual inspection of the sensor and its connections to identify any signs of physical damage or malfunction.
7. **Review system logs**: Review system logs to identify any other related issues or errors.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the sensor**: Isolate the sensor to prevent further damage or malfunction.
2. **Perform maintenance**: Perform routine maintenance on the sensor, including cleaning and calibration.
3. **Replace sensor (if necessary)**: If the sensor is faulty, replace it with a new one.
4. **Adjust sensor settings**: Adjust the sensor settings to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. **Test the sensor**: Test the sensor to ensure it is functioning correctly after maintenance or replacement.
6. **Update system configuration**: Update the system configuration to reflect any changes made to the sensor settings.
7. **Notify stakeholders**: Notify stakeholders of the issue and the steps taken to mitigate it.
