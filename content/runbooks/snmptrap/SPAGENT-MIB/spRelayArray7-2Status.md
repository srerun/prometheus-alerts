RelayArray7.2 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-2Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-2Status` SNMP trap indicates that a sensor has crossed a threshold on RelayArray7.2, triggering an alert.

## Impact

This trap can indicate a potential issue with the monitored system, which may lead to system downtime, data loss, or other unintended consequences if not addressed promptly.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sensor**: Use the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check sensor status**: Examine the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. **Review sensor value**: Check the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor that triggered the trap.
4. **Determine threshold exceeded**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold value that was exceeded, which triggered the trap.
5. **Consult sensor documentation**: Refer to the documentation for the specific sensor to understand the implications of the threshold being exceeded.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the cause**: Determine why the sensor threshold was exceeded. This may involve reviewing system logs, monitoring system performance, or consulting with system administrators.
2. **Take corrective action**: Based on the diagnosis, take corrective action to address the root cause of the issue. This may involve adjusting system settings, replacing hardware, or performing maintenance tasks.
3. **Verify sensor status**: After taking corrective action, verify that the sensor status has returned to normal by checking the `spSensorStatus` variable.
4. **Update sensor configuration**: If necessary, update the sensor configuration to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. **Notify stakeholders**: Inform relevant stakeholders of the issue and the steps taken to mitigate it.
