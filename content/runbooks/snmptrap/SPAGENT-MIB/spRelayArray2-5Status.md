# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-5Status 

RelayArray2.5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-5Status SNMP trap indicates that a sensor threshold has been exceeded on RelayArray2.5. This trap is sent when the sensor value reaches a level that requires attention, and it provides information about the sensor status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate a potential issue with the environment or equipment being monitored, such as:

* Increased temperature or humidity
* Power supply or voltage issues
* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Security breaches

Ignoring this trap may lead to equipment damage, data loss, or system downtime.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName`.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. Verify the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` value.
4. Check the `spSensorStatus` to determine if the sensor is in a normal, warning, or critical state.
5. Review the `spSensorDescription` to understand the context and implications of the sensor reading.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading that triggered the trap.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as:
	* Adjusting the environment or equipment to bring the sensor reading back within a normal range.
	* Replacing or repairing faulty equipment.
	* Implementing security measures to prevent breaches.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal state using the `spSensorValue` and `spSensorStatus`.
4. Update the sensor configuration and threshold levels as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the incident and resolution for future reference.
