# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-3Status 

RelayArray6.3 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-3Status trap is generated when the RelayArray6.3 sensor detects an abnormal condition. This trap is triggered when a specific threshold is exceeded, and it provides information about the sensor that triggered the trap.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Increased risk of hardware failure or damage
* Disruption of critical systems or services
* Loss of data or productivity
* Increased maintenance or replacement costs

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Identify the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor and the threshold.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the threshold exceedance and take corrective action.
2. Check the sensor for any signs of failure or damage and replace it if necessary.
3. Adjust the threshold settings for the sensor if necessary.
4. Implement additional monitoring or alerting to detect similar issues in the future.
5. Consider performing maintenance or repairs to prevent similar issues from occurring.

Note: The specific mitigation steps will depend on the details of the trap and the environment in which it was generated. This runbook provides a general framework for diagnosis and mitigation, but may need to be tailored to the specific use case.
