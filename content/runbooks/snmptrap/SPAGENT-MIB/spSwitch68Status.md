  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch68Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch68Status` trap is generated when a switch sensor reports a status change. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the trap, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded. This trap is critical for monitoring and troubleshooting switch sensor issues.

## Impact

The impact of this trap varies depending on the specific sensor and its function. However, potential impacts include:

* Disruption of network connectivity or performance
* Increased risk of hardware failure or damage
* Inaccurate monitoring or reporting of environmental conditions
* Unplanned downtime or maintenance

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Review the sensor value and the level that was exceeded using the `spSensorValue` and `spSensorLevelExceeded` variables.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable for more information about the sensor and its function.
5. Check the switch logs for additional error messages or events related to the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor status change (e.g., temperature, voltage, or other environmental factors).
2. Take corrective action to resolve the underlying issue (e.g., adjust the sensor threshold, replace a faulty sensor, or troubleshoot the switch).
3. Verify that the sensor status has returned to normal using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
4. Implement monitoring and alerting to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the root cause and resolution in the incident management system.
