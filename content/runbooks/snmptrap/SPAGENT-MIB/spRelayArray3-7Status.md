# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3-7Status 

RelayArray3.7 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray3-7Status trap indicates that the RelayArray3.7 sensor has triggered an alert. This sensor is designed to monitor a specific aspect of the system, and the trigger indicates that a threshold has been exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the threshold that has been exceeded. However, in general, this trap indicates that the system is operating outside of normal parameters and may require attention to prevent damage or data loss. The specific impact could include:

* System downtime or instability
* Data loss or corruption
* Increased risk of hardware failure
* Decreased system performance

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of the trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the purpose and location of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the threshold exceedance and take corrective action to bring the sensor reading back within normal parameters.
2. Check the system logs for related errors or warnings that may indicate the root cause of the issue.
3. Perform a visual inspection of the sensor and related hardware to ensure there are no physical issues or damage.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold settings for the sensor to prevent false positives or nuisance alarms.
5. Notify relevant teams or personnel of the issue and the steps taken to resolve it.
