# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-5Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-5Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides critical information about the sensor's status, value, and exceeded level, helping administrators quickly identify and respond to potential temperature-related issues.

## Impact

* The system or component being monitored may be at risk of overheating, which can lead to hardware damage, reduced performance, or even complete system failure.
* If left unchecked, elevated temperatures can cause data loss, corruption, or other secondary issues.
* In extreme cases, high temperatures can pose a risk to personnel safety.

## Diagnosis

* Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor (e.g., OK, WARNING, CRITICAL).
* Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to obtain the current temperature reading.
* Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand the threshold value that was exceeded.
* Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
* Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to gather more information about the sensor and its location.

## Mitigation

* Immediate action is required to address the elevated temperature:
	+ Check the system or component for any signs of physical damage or malfunction.
	+ Verify that cooling systems (e.g., fans, air conditioning) are functioning correctly.
	+ Ensure proper airflow around the system or component.
	+ Consider relocating the system or component to a cooler environment.
	+ If necessary, shut down the system or component to prevent further damage.
* Schedule a maintenance window to investigate and resolve the underlying cause of the temperature increase.
* Consider adjusting temperature thresholds or implementing additional monitoring to prevent similar issues in the future.
