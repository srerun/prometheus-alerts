# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch65Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

This trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, triggering an alert. The sensor could be monitoring various parameters such as temperature, voltage, or fan speed.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential issue with the switch's operation or environmental conditions. If left unaddressed, it could lead to system downtime, data loss, or hardware damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Check the level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the switch's documentation or manufacturer's guidelines to understand the recommended operating range for the sensor.
5. Verify that the sensor reading is accurate and not a result of a faulty sensor or misconfiguration.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the sensor threshold exceedance. This may involve adjusting the switch's environmental conditions, repairing or replacing faulty components, or adjusting system configuration.
2. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a safe operating range using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Update the switch's configuration or monitoring system to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
4. Perform a thorough inspection of the switch and its components to ensure that there are no other potential issues that could lead to system downtime or data loss.
