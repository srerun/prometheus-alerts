  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning
This SNMP trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, triggering an alarm. The specific sensor and its corresponding values are included in the trap message.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that the switch is reporting an issue with one of its sensors. This could indicate a hardware problem, environmental issue, or other fault that requires attention. Ignoring this trap could lead to further damage or downtime if left unresolved.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context of the alarm.
5. Verify the status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor alarm, such as a hardware fault or environmental issue.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as replacing a faulty component or adjusting the environment.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal state.
4. Clear the alarm in the monitoring system.
5. Perform a thorough check of the switch to ensure that there are no other issues or alarms present.
