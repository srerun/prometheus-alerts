RelayArray7.8 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-8Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray7-8Status` SNMP trap is generated when a sensor related to the RelayArray7.8 sensor trap exceeds a certain threshold. This trap indicates a potential issue with the sensor or the equipment it is monitoring.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold that has been exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Equipment malfunction or failure
* Decreased system performance
* Increased risk of downtime or data loss
* Potential safety hazards (e.g. if the sensor is monitoring environmental conditions)

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to determine if there are any other related issues or symptoms.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold being exceeded (e.g. equipment failure, environmental conditions, etc.).
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue (e.g. replace faulty equipment, adjust environmental settings, etc.).
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal level.
4. Clear the trap and acknowledge the resolution of the issue in the monitoring system.
5. Consider adjusting the threshold settings for the sensor to prevent future false alarms or to provide earlier warning of potential issues.
