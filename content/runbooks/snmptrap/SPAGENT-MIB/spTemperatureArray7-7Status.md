Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-7Status`:

## Meaning

This trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold. The sensor is part of an array of temperature sensors, and this specific trap is related to sensor 7-7.

## Impact

A temperature sensor exceeding its threshold can indicate a potential equipment failure or a problem with the environment. If left unchecked, this could lead to downtime, data loss, or even physical damage to equipment or the surrounding infrastructure.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
2. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
3. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
4. Review the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the location and purpose of the affected sensor.
5. Check the sensor's status using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
6. Consult the equipment's documentation and logs to determine if there are any other related issues or errors.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the affected sensor and its surrounding environment.
2. Take corrective action to bring the temperature back within a safe range, such as adjusting the cooling system or relocating equipment.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
4. Check for any other sensors that may be approaching their thresholds and take proactive measures to prevent further issues.
5. Consider adjusting the threshold levels for the temperature sensor array to prevent future occurrences.
6. Update the equipment's documentation and logs to reflect the issue and the actions taken to resolve it.

By following these steps, you can quickly diagnose and mitigate the issue, reducing the risk of downtime, data loss, or physical damage to equipment or the surrounding infrastructure.
