# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch37Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch37Status trap is generated when a switch sensor reports a status change. This trap is sent when a sensor on the switch exceeded a certain level, indicating a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is limited to the specific sensor that triggered the trap. However, depending on the sensor and its function, it may affect the overall performance, reliability, or availability of the switch or the network. For example, a temperature sensor exceeding a certain level may indicate a cooling issue that, if left unchecked, could lead to a switch failure.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by looking at the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor (e.g., okay, warning, critical).
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` to the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the sensor and the potential impact of the exceeded threshold.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor exceeding the threshold (e.g., temperature issue, fan failure, etc.).
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause (e.g., clean the switch, replace a fan, etc.).
3. Monitor the sensor to ensure the value returns to a safe range.
4. Consider configuring alerts or thresholds for other sensors to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Update maintenance schedules or procedures to prevent similar issues from occurring.
