# SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy5Status 

Energy sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy5Status trap is generated when an energy sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold, indicating a potential issue with the system's power consumption or availability. This trap is used to alert administrators to take corrective action to prevent potential outages or equipment damage.

## Impact

* Potential loss of system availability or data
* Increased risk of equipment damage or failure
* Inefficient power consumption leading to higher energy costs
* Possible impact on business operations and revenue

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the energy sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the energy sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Check system logs and monitoring tools for any additional error messages or indicators of system stress.
6. Consult with facilities or data center management to determine if there are any issues with the power infrastructure.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and address the root cause of the energy sensor threshold exceedance.
2. Verify that the system's power consumption is within recommended specifications.
3. Implement power-saving measures, such as turning off unnecessary devices or adjusting system settings.
4. Consider upgrading or replacing equipment to improve power efficiency.
5. Update the energy sensor threshold levels to prevent false alarms.
6. Schedule regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure the system remains within recommended power consumption levels.
