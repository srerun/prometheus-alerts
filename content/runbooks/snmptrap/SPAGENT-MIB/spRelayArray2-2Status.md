# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-2Status 

RelayArray2.2 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-2Status trap indicates that a sensor on the RelayArray2.2 has reached a critical level, triggering an alert. This trap provides important information about the sensor's current status, value, and threshold levels.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, which may indicate a potential issue with the system or environment being monitored. This could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or other negative consequences if left unaddressed.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold level that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the threshold level.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting the sensor settings or performing maintenance on the system being monitored.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal level.
4. Update the sensor threshold levels or alarm settings as necessary to prevent future false alarms.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference.
