# SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue3Status 

Analogue Sensor Type 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue3Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue3Status` trap is generated when an analogue sensor reports a status change. This trap is sent when the sensor value exceeds a predefined threshold, indicating a potential issue with the monitored environment.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its role in the system. However, it can potentially indicate a problem with the environment, such as:

* Temperature or humidity exceeding safe limits
* Airflow or pressure changes affecting system performance
* Unusual vibrations or noise levels
* Other environmental factors that may impact system reliability or performance

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, investigate the sensor that triggered the trap using the following variables:

* `spSensorStatus`: Check the current status of the sensor to identify the specific issue.
* `spSensorValue`: Review the current value of the sensor to determine if it has exceeded a safe threshold.
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: Verify the level that was exceeded to understand the severity of the issue.
* `spSensorIndex`: Use the sensor index to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
* `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription`: Review the sensor name and description to understand its role and purpose in the system.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Verify the sensor reading**: Check the sensor reading to ensure it is accurate and not faulty.
2. **Check the threshold**: Verify that the threshold value is correctly set and adjust it if necessary.
3. **Investigate the environment**: Inspect the environment to identify the root cause of the issue, such as a temperature or humidity spike.
4. **Take corrective action**: Based on the diagnosis, take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as adjusting the environment or replacing the sensor if faulty.
5. **Clear the trap**: Once the issue is resolved, clear the trap to prevent further notifications.
