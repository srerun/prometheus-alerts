Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-5Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides critical information about the sensor's status, value, and level exceeded, allowing for prompt investigation and remediation.

## Impact

* The device emitting this trap may be experiencing overheating or temperature-related issues, which can lead to hardware failure, data loss, or system downtime.
* Ignoring this trap may result in extended outages, decreased system performance, or even complete system failure.

## Diagnosis

1. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Consult the device's temperature monitoring system or logs to determine the trend of temperature changes leading up to the trap.
5. Perform a visual inspection of the device to identify any signs of overheating, such as blown fuses, tripped breakers, or damaged components.

## Mitigation

1. Immediately investigate the root cause of the temperature increase, considering factors such as:
	* Environmental issues (e.g., high ambient temperature, poor airflow)
	* Cooling system failures or malfunctions
	* Component failures or malfunctions
	* Software or firmware issues
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause, such as:
	* Moving the device to a cooler location
	* Cleaning or replacing air filters
	* Repairing or replacing faulty components
	* Applying software or firmware updates
3. Verify that the `spSensorValue` has returned to a normal range and the `spSensorStatus` indicates a healthy state.
4. Schedule a follow-up check to ensure the issue has been fully resolved and to prevent future occurrences.
5. Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting measures to proactively detect temperature-related issues before they become critical.
