# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-1Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is the runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray7-1Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, triggering an alert. This trap provides critical information about the temperature sensor's status, value, and the level that was exceeded, helping administrators quickly diagnose and mitigate the issue.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as elevated temperatures can lead to equipment failure, downtime, and even damage to the surrounding environment. Ignoring this trap can result in costly repairs, loss of productivity, and compromise of data integrity.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the affected sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor status**: Examine the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor (e.g., alarm, warning, or critical).
3. **Verify the temperature value**: Review the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current temperature reading that exceed the predetermined level.
4. **Determine the exceeded level**: Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand the specific temperature threshold that was breached.
5. **Consult sensor metadata**: Use the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to gather more information about the sensor and its location.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the cause**: Identify the root cause of the temperature increase, such as a failure in the cooling system or a blockage in the air vents.
2. **Take corrective action**: Implement measures to reduce the temperature, such as restarting the cooling system, cleaning the air vents, or replacing faulty components.
3. **Verify sensor readings**: Monitor the temperature sensor's readings to ensure the issue has been resolved and the temperature has returned to a safe range.
4. **Update sensor configuration**: If necessary, adjust the temperature threshold settings to prevent future traps from being triggered unnecessarily.
5. **Perform preventative maintenance**: Schedule regular maintenance checks to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
