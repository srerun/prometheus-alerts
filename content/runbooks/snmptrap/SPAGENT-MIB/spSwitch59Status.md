  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch59Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch59Status` trap is generated when a switch sensor reports a status change or exceeded threshold. This trap indicates that a sensor on the switch has reached a critical level, requiring immediate attention to prevent potential downtime or performance degradation.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Temperature exceeding a critical level, which can cause equipment failure or downtime
* Power supply issues, leading to potential power outages or equipment failure
* Fan failure, which can cause overheating and equipment failure
* Other environmental or hardware-related issues that may affect switch performance or availability

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current sensor value using the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the severity of the issue.
3. Verify the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the switch documentation or vendor support resources to understand the implications of the exceeded threshold for the specific sensor.
5. Perform additional troubleshooting steps as necessary to isolate the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the exceeded threshold, such as:
	* Verifying and cleaning dust from fans or air vents
	* Replacing failed power supplies or other components
	* Adjusting environmental settings, such as temperature or humidity
2. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Clear the trap and verify that no additional traps are being generated for the same sensor.
4. Schedule a maintenance window to perform any necessary repairs or replacements to prevent future occurrences.
5. Update monitoring and alerting configurations to ensure timely notification of similar issues in the future.
