# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-7Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray4-7Status trap is generated when a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold. This trap is sent to alert administrators of a potential environmental issue that may impact system performance or reliability.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. However, in general, high temperatures can cause:

* System slowdowns or shutdowns
* Data loss or corruption
* Reduced lifespan of components
* Increased risk of hardware failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Compare the current temperature value to the threshold exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context of the temperature reading.
5. Check the system's environmental monitoring logs to identify if this is an isolated incident or a recurring issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, perform the following steps:

1. Verify that the temperature reading is accurate and not a faulty sensor reading.
2. Check the environmental conditions around the system, such as air flow, cooling system functionality, and ambient temperature.
3. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as adjusting cooling system settings, cleaning air vents, or relocating the system to a cooler environment.
4. Consider configuring additional monitoring and alerting for temperature sensors to catch potential issues before they become critical.
5. If the issue persists, consider contacting a system administrator or facilities manager for further assistance.
