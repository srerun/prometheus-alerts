**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spEnergy6Status trap is an energy sensor trap that indicates a status change in one of the energy sensors. This trap is sent when a sensor's value exceeds a certain level, requiring attention from the operations team.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as it may indicate a problem with the energy consumption or availability of a critical system or device. Ignoring this trap may lead to:

* Increased energy costs
* Equipment damage or failure
* Disruption to critical business operations
* Inability to meet environmental or sustainability goals

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName`.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` to determine the current state of the sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorLevelExceeded` to understand the threshold that was breached.
4. Review the `spSensorDescription` to understand the context and purpose of the sensor.
5. Investigate the system or device associated with the sensor to identify the underlying cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the underlying cause of the sensor's status change.
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the readings are accurate.
3. Adjust the thresholds or settings for the sensor to prevent similar issues in the future.
4. Implement monitoring and alerting to detect similar issues before they escalate.
5. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it to improve future diagnosis and mitigation.
