# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch15Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch15Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predefined threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the switch sensor is operating outside of its normal range, which may indicate a potential environmental issue, such as high temperature or humidity, that could affect the switch's performance or reliability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor's description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the threshold exceedance.
5. Verify the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity, to determine if they are within normal operating ranges.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance, such as a faulty sensor or environmental issue.
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause of the issue, such as replacing the sensor or adjusting the environmental conditions.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to within normal operating ranges.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the sensor to prevent future false alarms.
5. Update the switch's configuration to reflect any changes made to the sensor or environmental conditions.
