# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMSStatus 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is the runbook for the SNMP Trap:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMSStatus trap indicates that an IRMS (Intelligent Remote Management System) sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent when a monitored sensor value reaches a critical level, requiring attention from the operations team.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that the IRMS system has detected an abnormal condition that may affect the performance, reliability, or safety of the system. If left unaddressed, this issue could lead to equipment failure, data loss, or environmental damage.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the root cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using `spSensorValue`.
3. Determine the level that was exceeded using `spSensorLevelExceeded`.
4. Review the sensor description using `spSensorDescription` to understand the context of the sensor reading.
5. Consult the system logs and monitoring tools to gather more information about the incident.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the abnormal condition indicated by the sensor reading.
2. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a safe range.
3. Perform a thorough analysis to identify the root cause of the issue and implement corrective actions to prevent future occurrences.
4. Update the system configuration or adjust the sensor threshold as necessary to prevent similar alerts.
5. Document the incident and the resolution steps taken to improve future response and prevention.
