# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature1Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature1Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold value. This trap is generated by a temperature sensor that is monitored by the SNMP agent.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as high temperatures can cause damage to equipment, lead to system failures, and result in downtime. If left unaddressed, this can lead to data loss, reputational damage, and revenue loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by looking at the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value by looking at the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold value that was exceeded by looking at the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor's description by looking at the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand its significance.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the temperature reading is accurate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the temperature sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
2. Check the equipment or system associated with the sensor to ensure it is operating within normal parameters.
3. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as increasing airflow, switching to a redundant system, or shutting down the system to prevent damage.
4. Update the threshold value for the sensor to prevent future occurrences.
5. Monitor the sensor and system closely to ensure that the issue does not reoccur.
