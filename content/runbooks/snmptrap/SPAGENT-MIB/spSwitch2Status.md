# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch2Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch2Status trap is generated when a switch sensor exceeds a predetermined level. This trap is intended to alert network administrators to potential issues with switch hardware or environmental conditions.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that it may indicate a hardware or environmental issue with the switch, which could lead to downtime or degraded performance if not addressed. Depending on the type of sensor and the level exceeded, the issue could be critical (e.g. high temperature) or minor (e.g. low fan speed). Failure to respond to this trap could result in more severe consequences, such as equipment failure or data loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the **spSensorStatus** variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Review the **spSensorValue** variable to see the current value of the sensor.
3. Compare the **spSensorValue** to the **spSensorLevelExceeded** variable to determine why the trap was generated.
4. Use the **spSensorIndex** variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Review the **spSensorName** and **spSensorDescription** variables to understand the type of sensor and its purpose.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceeding the predetermined level.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as:
	* Adjusting environmental conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity) if necessary.
	* Replacing or repairing faulty hardware components.
	* Adjusting system configurations or firmware as needed.
3. Verify that the sensor reading has returned to a normal state.
4. If necessary, update the sensor configuration or thresholds to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the incident and the actions taken to resolve it for future reference.
