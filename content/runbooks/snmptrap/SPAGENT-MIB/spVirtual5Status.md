Virtual5 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual5Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual5Status` trap is triggered when a Virtual5 sensor reports a status change. This trap is sent by the sensor agent to notify the network management system of an unusual condition or threshold exceedance.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the Virtual5 sensor is reporting an abnormal reading, which may indicate a potential issue with the monitored system or environment. This could lead to system downtime, performance degradation, or data loss if left unattended.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, check the following variables:

* `spSensorStatus`: The current status of the sensor, which may indicate the severity of the issue.
* `spSensorValue`: The current reading of the sensor, which may indicate the threshold exceeded.
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: The level that was exceeded, which may indicate the threshold setting.
* `spSensorIndex`: The index of the sensor, which may help identify the specific sensor causing the issue.
* `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription`: The name and description of the sensor, which may provide additional context.

Check the sensor logs and system monitoring tools to determine the root cause of the issue. Verify the sensor configuration and threshold settings to ensure they are correct.

## Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, take the following steps:

* Investigate the cause of the sensor reading exceedance and take corrective action to resolve the issue.
* Verify that the sensor configuration and threshold settings are correct.
* Adjust the threshold settings or sensor configuration as needed to prevent false positives or unnecessary notifications.
* Perform maintenance or repairs on the monitored system or environment as needed to prevent further issues.
* Clear the trap and reset the sensor status once the issue has been resolved.
