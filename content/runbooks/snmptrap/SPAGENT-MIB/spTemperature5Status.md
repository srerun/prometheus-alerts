# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature5Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature5Status SNMP trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a threshold level, triggering an alert. This trap provides critical information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as high temperatures can cause damage to equipment, lead to downtime, and even result in safety risks. Prompt response to this trap is essential to prevent or minimize potential damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the affected sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor status**: Examine the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. **Determine the threshold level**: Use the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold level that was exceeded.
4. **Check the sensor value**: Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current value of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the cause**: Determine the root cause of the high temperature reading, such as a malfunctioning sensor, environmental factors, or equipment failure.
2. **Take corrective action**: Based on the diagnosis, take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as replacing the sensor, adjusting the environment, or repairing equipment.
3. **Verify the sensor value**: Use the `spSensorValue` variable to verify that the temperature reading has returned to a safe level.
4. **Update monitoring systems**: Update monitoring systems to reflect the changes made to the sensor or equipment.
5. **Document the incident**: Document the incident, including the root cause, actions taken, and any changes made to the system.
