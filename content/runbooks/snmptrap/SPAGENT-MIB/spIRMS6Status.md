# SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS6Status 

IRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spIRMS6Status trap is generated when an IRMS (Intelligent Remote Management System) sensor reports an out-of-bounds value, indicating a potential issue with the monitored system or device. This trap is sent to alert administrators of a possible problem that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the threshold exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate:

* Overheating or cooling issues
* Power supply problems
* Environmental concerns (e.g., humidity, temperature)
* Other system or device malfunctions

 Failure to respond to this trap may lead to system downtime, data loss, or equipment damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sensor**: Use the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables to determine which sensor triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor value**: Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to understand the current reading of the sensor.
3. **Determine the threshold**: Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to learn the specific level that was exceeded, triggering the trap.
4. **Consult the sensor description**: Refer to the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor and its normal operating range.
5. **Verify system status**: Check the system or device being monitored to identify any signs of malfunction or distress.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the sensor reading**: Verify that the sensor reading is accurate and not a false alarm.
2. **Take corrective action**: Based on the sensor reading and system status, take immediate action to address the underlying issue. This may involve adjusting environmental settings, replacing faulty components, or performing maintenance tasks.
3. **Monitor system status**: Closely monitor the system or device to ensure the issue is resolved and does not recur.
4. **Adjust sensor thresholds**: If necessary, adjust the sensor thresholds to prevent false alarms or optimize monitoring.
5. **Update documentation**: Update system documentation to reflect the changes made and the root cause of the issue.
