# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch14Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch14Status trap is sent when a switch sensor exceeds a predetermined level, indicating a potential issue with the switch's environmental or operational conditions. This trap is triggered by a sensor on the switch, which could be related to temperature, voltage, fan speed, or other environmental factors.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor that triggered the trap and the level exceeded. If left unaddressed, the issue could lead to:

* Switch failure or shutdown
* Disruption to network connectivity and services
* Data loss or corruption
* Increased risk of hardware damage or failure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by examining the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` and `spSensorLevelExceeded` variables to understand the current value and the level that was exceeded.
3. Review the switch's event logs and system logs for related errors or warnings.
4. Verify the switch's environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and power supply.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor issue, based on the diagnosis.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as:
	* Adjusting the switch's environmental settings (e.g., temperature or humidity).
	* Replacing a faulty fan or power supply unit.
	* Cleaning or replacing a dirty or failed sensor.
3. Verify that the sensor value has returned to a normal range and the trap is no longer being sent.
4. Consider adjusting the sensor threshold or setting up additional monitoring to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the root cause and resolution in the issue tracking system for future reference.
