  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch40Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, triggering an alert. This trap provides detailed information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and description.

## Impact

This trap can indicate a potential issue with the switch, such as overheating, high voltage, or other environmental issues that may affect its performance or reliability. If left unchecked, these issues can lead to system downtime, data loss, or even equipment failure.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the alert using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` and `spSensorValue` variables to determine the current status and value of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the description of the sensor and the level that was exceeded (`spSensorLevelExceeded`).
4. Check the switch's logs and monitoring systems for additional information about the issue.
5. Physically inspect the switch and sensor to determine if there are any signs of damage or malfunction.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the issue indicated by the sensor, such as reducing the temperature or voltage in the environment.
2. Verify that the switch is functioning properly and that there are no other issues that need to be addressed.
3. Check the switch's configuration to ensure that it is set up correctly and that the sensor threshold values are appropriate.
4. Consider implementing additional monitoring or alerting mechanisms to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the issue and the resolution in the system's maintenance records.
