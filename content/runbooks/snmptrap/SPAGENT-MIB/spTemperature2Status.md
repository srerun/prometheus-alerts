# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature2Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperature2Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has crossed a threshold. This trap is generated when the temperature reading from a sensor exceeds a predefined level, signifying a potential issue with the equipment or environment.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a critical situation that requires immediate attention. If left unchecked, high temperatures can lead to:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Data loss or corruption
* Reduced system performance
* Increased risk of fire or electrical hazards
* Damage to surrounding infrastructure

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature reading using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Verify the sensor's status using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the sensor's purpose and location.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Immediately investigate the sensor's location and verify the temperature reading.
2. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature, such as:
	* Adjusting cooling systems or air flow.
	* Restarting or replacing faulty equipment.
	* Isolating the affected area to prevent further damage.
3. Verify that the temperature has returned to a safe level before considering the issue resolved.
4. Update the sensor's configuration or threshold levels as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Schedule a follow-up review to ensure the issue is fully resolved and to identify opportunities for preventative measures.
