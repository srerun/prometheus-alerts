# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray2-4Status 

RelayArray2.4 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning
This SNMP trap is generated when the RelayArray2.4 sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, indicating a potential issue with the sensor or the environment it is monitoring.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that the sensor is operating outside of its normal range, which may indicate a problem with the sensor itself or the system being monitored. This could lead to unexpected behavior, errors, or even system downtime if left unchecked.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, review the following variables:

* `spSensorStatus`: Check the current status of the sensor to determine the nature of the issue.
* `spSensorValue`: Review the current value of the sensor to determine the extent of the issue.
* `spSensorLevelExceeded`: Identify the level that was exceeded to understand the threshold that triggered the trap.
* `spSensorIndex`: Determine the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
* `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription`: Review the name and description of the sensor to understand its function and the system it is monitoring.

Perform additional troubleshooting steps as necessary, such as:

* Checking the sensor for physical damage or malfunction.
* Verifying that the sensor is properly configured and calibrated.
* Reviewing system logs for related errors or issues.
* Consulting with system administrators or subject matter experts for further guidance.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, take the following steps:

* If the sensor is faulty, replace it with a functional one.
* If the sensor is properly functioning, adjust the threshold levels to prevent false positives.
* Verify that the system is operating within normal parameters and that there are no underlying issues that contributed to the sensor exceeding its normal range.
* Document the issue and the steps taken to resolve it in the incident management system.
* Schedule a follow-up review to ensure the issue has been fully resolved and that the sensor is operating within normal parameters.
