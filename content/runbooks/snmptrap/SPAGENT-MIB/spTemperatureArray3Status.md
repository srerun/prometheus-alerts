### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray3Status` trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a set threshold, triggering an alert. This trap is sent when the temperature reading from the sensor exceeds the configured level.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can be significant, as high temperatures can cause hardware failures, data loss, or even physical damage to equipment. If left unattended, this issue can lead to costly repairs, downtime, and impact on business operations.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the sensor index (`spSensorIndex`) and name (`spSensorName`) to identify the specific temperature sensor that triggered the trap.
2. Verify the current temperature reading (`spSensorValue`) and the level that was exceeded (`spSensorLevelExceeded`).
3. Review the sensor description (`spSensorDescription`) to understand the context of the temperature reading.
4. Check the system logs and monitoring tools to identify if there are any other related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the temperature reading is accurate and not a false alarm.
2. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as adjusting cooling systems or replacing failed components.
3. Investigate the root cause of the temperature increase, such as a faulty fan or clogged air vents.
4. Update the temperature threshold levels to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Schedule a maintenance check to ensure that the temperature sensor is functioning correctly and that the issue is fully resolved.

By following these steps, you can quickly identify and resolve temperature-related issues, minimizing the impact on your infrastructure and ensuring business continuity.
