# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-7Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-7Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and description.

## Impact

This trap can have a significant impact on the system, as high temperatures can cause hardware damage or failure. Ignoring this trap can lead to system downtime, data loss, and increased maintenance costs.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Verify the temperature threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the location and type of sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check system logs for any related errors or warnings.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the system's cooling system is functioning properly.
2. Check for any blockages or obstructions that may be contributing to the high temperature.
3. Consider relocating the sensor or the system to a cooler environment.
4. Adjust the temperature threshold to a more suitable level if necessary.
5. Implement additional monitoring and alerting mechanisms to ensure timely notification of temperature issues.
6. Perform regular maintenance and cleaning of the system to prevent overheating.
7. Consider replacing the sensor or the system if it is malfunctioning or damaged.
