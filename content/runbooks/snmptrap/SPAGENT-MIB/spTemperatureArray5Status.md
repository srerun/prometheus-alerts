### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5Status` SNMP trap is a temperature sensor alert generated by a device. This trap is triggered when the temperature reading from a specific sensor exceeds a predetermined threshold.

## Impact

* If left unchecked, excessive temperatures can lead to equipment failure, downtime, and potential data loss.
* The impact can vary depending on the specific device and the criticality of the system it supports.
* In severe cases, high temperatures can cause permanent damage to hardware components, requiring costly repairs or replacement.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
2. Check the current temperature reading using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the location and type of sensor that triggered the alert.
5. Verify the device's environmental conditions, such as airflow, cooling system status, and ambient temperature.
6. Check for any recent changes or maintenance activities that may have contributed to the temperature increase.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify that the device is properly ventilated and that air flows are not blocked.
2. Check the cooling system (if present) to ensure it is functioning correctly.
3. Investigate and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to the temperature increase (e.g., faulty fans, clogged air filters).
4. If the temperature reading is critically high, consider powering down the device or taking other emergency measures to prevent further damage.
5. Implement additional monitoring to track temperature readings and receive alerts before the threshold is exceeded again.
6. Consider installing temperature sensors in other critical areas to ensure comprehensive monitoring and early detection of potential issues.
