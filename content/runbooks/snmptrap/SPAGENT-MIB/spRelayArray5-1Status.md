**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the given SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray5-1Status trap is triggered when the RelayArray5.1 sensor exceeds a set threshold. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that it may indicate a problem with the RelayArray5.1 sensor, which could affect the overall performance and reliability of the system. If left unchecked, this issue could lead to further complications, such as equipment failure or data loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the sensor index using the `spSensorIndex` variable.
5. Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to gather more information about the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance, such as environmental factors or equipment malfunction.
2. Take corrective action to restore the sensor to a normal operating state, such as adjusting the sensor settings or replacing faulty equipment.
3. Monitor the sensor closely to ensure the issue does not recur.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold settings to prevent false positives or to ensure that the system is alerted to potential issues in a timely manner.
5. Update documentation to reflect any changes made to the sensor settings or equipment.
