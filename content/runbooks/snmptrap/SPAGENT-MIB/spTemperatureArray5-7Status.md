: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent

: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-7Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray5-7Status` SNMP trap is generated when a temperature sensor in the system reports a value that exceeds a predetermined threshold. This trap is triggered by a specific temperature sensor, identified by the `spSensorIndex`, and the current temperature value is reported in `spSensorValue`.

## Impact

This trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a critical level, which could potentially lead to system instability, overheating, or even hardware failure. If left unaddressed, this could result in:

* System crashes or shutdowns
* Data loss or corruption
* Hardware damage or failure
* Downtime and reduced productivity

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName`.
2. Check the current temperature value reported in `spSensorValue`.
3. Verify the threshold level that was exceeded, reported in `spSensorLevelExceeded`.
4. Check system logs for any errors or warnings related to temperature issues.
5. Physically inspect the sensor and surrounding components for signs of damage or malfunction.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as:
	* Turning off non-essential systems or components
	* Increasing cooling fan speeds
	* Ensuring proper airflow around the system
2. Investigate and address the root cause of the temperature issue, such as:
	* Faulty or malfunctioning sensors
	* Blocked or clogged air vents
	* Inadequate cooling systems
3. Implement measures to prevent future temperature exceedances, such as:
	* Adjusting temperature thresholds
	* Implementing temperature monitoring and alerting systems
	* Scheduling regular system maintenance and cleaning
4. Consider replacing or repairing the affected sensor or component to ensure system reliability and stability.
