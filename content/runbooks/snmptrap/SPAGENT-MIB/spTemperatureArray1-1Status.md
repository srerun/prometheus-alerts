# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-1Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-1Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, triggering an alert. This trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the device's temperature.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific device and environment. However, in general, high temperatures can lead to:

* Device malfunction or failure
* Data loss or corruption
* System downtime
* Reduced lifespan of components

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Check the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` variable to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` variables to understand the location and type of sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the high temperature reading (e.g., check for air flow blockages, malfunctioning fans, etc.).
2. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature (e.g., clean dust from vents, replace failed fans, etc.).
3. Verify that the temperature has returned to a safe range.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level for the temperature sensor to prevent false alarms.
5. Document the incident and resolution in a knowledge base or incident management system for future reference.
