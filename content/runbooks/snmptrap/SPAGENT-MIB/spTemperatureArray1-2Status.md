# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-2Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-2Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has reached a critical level, exceeding a predetermined threshold. This trap is sent to alert administrators of a potential thermal issue with a device or system.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the system or device affected. However, in general, high temperatures can lead to:

* Reduced system performance
* Increased risk of hardware failure
* Data loss or corruption
* System downtime

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current temperature value reported by the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold value that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Verify the sensor status using the `spSensorStatus` variable.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to identify if other sensors or components are also affected.
6. Physically inspect the system or device to identify any signs of overheating, such as excessive fan noise or hot surfaces.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to reduce the temperature of the system or device, such as:
	* Turning off unnecessary components or systems.
	* Increasing cooling fan speeds.
	* Improving air circulation around the system or device.
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and is not faulty.
3. Adjust the threshold value for the sensor to prevent false alarms or unnecessary traps.
4. Implement long-term solutions to prevent overheating, such as:
	* Upgrading cooling systems.
	* Improving system airflow.
	* Reducing system load or consolidating resources.
5. Monitor the system or device closely to ensure the temperature returns to a safe level and remains stable.
