### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description `SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS6Status`:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap is generated when a VRMS (Voltage Regulator Module) sensor exceeds a predefined threshold. The trap is sent to notify administrators of a potential issue with the VRMS sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is that the VRMS sensor has exceeded a critical level, which may indicate a potential hardware failure or overheating issue. If left unattended, this could lead to system downtime, data loss, or even physical damage to the hardware.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Review the sensor status**: Check the value of `spSensorStatus` to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. **Check the sensor value**: Review the value of `spSensorValue` to determine the current reading of the sensor.
3. **Determine the exceeded level**: Check the value of `spSensorLevelExceeded` to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. **Identify the sensor**: Use the values of `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` to identify the specific VRMS sensor that triggered the trap.
5. **Consult system logs**: Review system logs to see if there are any related error messages or warnings that may indicate the root cause of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, the following steps should be taken:

1. **Investigate the sensor**: Physically inspect the VRMS sensor to ensure it is properly connected and functioning correctly.
2. **Check system configuration**: Verify that the system configuration is correct and that the VRMS sensor is properly configured.
3. **Adjust threshold levels**: Consider adjusting the threshold levels for the VRMS sensor to prevent false positives or unnecessary traps.
4. **Perform maintenance**: Schedule maintenance to clean or replace the VRMS sensor if necessary.
5. **Monitor system performance**: Closely monitor system performance to ensure that the issue does not recur.
