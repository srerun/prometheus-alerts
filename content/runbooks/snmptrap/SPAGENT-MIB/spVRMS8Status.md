VRMS sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS8Status trap indicates that a voltage regulator module sensor (VRMS) has exceeded a configured threshold, triggering this notification. The trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

This trap may indicate a potential issue with the voltage regulator module, which could lead to system instability or component failure if left unchecked.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` to understand the current reading of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Use the `spSensorIndex` to identify the specific sensor that triggered the alert.
5. Check the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` to understand the purpose and function of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify the voltage regulator module is functioning correctly and adjust the configuration as needed.
2. Check the system logs for any other related errors or alerts.
3. Perform additional diagnostic tests to determine the root cause of the issue.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold levels for the VRMS sensor to prevent false positives.
5. If the issue persists, consider replacing the voltage regulator module or seeking assistance from a qualified technician.
