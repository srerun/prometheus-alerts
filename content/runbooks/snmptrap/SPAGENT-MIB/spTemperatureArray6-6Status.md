  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-6Status`:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray6-6Status trap indicates that a temperature sensor has exceeded a certain threshold. This trap is sent when the sensor value exceeds a predefined level, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is significant, as high temperatures can cause equipment failure, data loss, or even physical damage to the device. If left unchecked, this condition can lead to system downtime, affecting business operations and causing revenue loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` to see the current temperature reading.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName`.
5. Review the `spSensorDescription` to understand the location and purpose of the sensor.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Verify the temperature reading is accurate and not a faulty sensor reading.
2. Check the device's temperature threshold settings to ensure they are correctly configured.
3. Verify that the cooling system is functioning properly and air vents are not blocked.
4. Consider relocating the device to a cooler environment or adding additional cooling systems.
5. Monitor the temperature sensor readings closely to ensure the issue does not persist.
6. If the issue persists, consider replacing the device or consulting with a hardware specialist.
