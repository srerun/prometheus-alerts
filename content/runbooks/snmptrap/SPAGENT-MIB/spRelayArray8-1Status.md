# SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-1Status 

RelayArray8.1 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning
The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray8-1Status` trap is triggered when a sensor in the RelayArray8.1 sensor group exceeds a certain threshold or level. This trap alerts administrators to a potential issue with the sensor that may impact system performance or functionality.

## Impact
The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the level exceeded. Potential impacts include:

* System downtime or instability
* Loss of data or functionality
* Increased risk of hardware failure
* Decreased system performance

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the level that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the significance of the sensor and the level exceeded.
5. Verify the current status of the sensor using the `spSensorStatus` variable.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor threshold exceedance (e.g., environmental factors, hardware failure, software issue).
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying cause (e.g., adjust environmental settings, replace faulty hardware, update software).
3. Monitor the sensor value and status to ensure the issue is resolved.
4. Consider adjusting the threshold level or setting up additional monitoring or alerting to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Document the issue and resolution in a knowledge base or incident management system for future reference.
