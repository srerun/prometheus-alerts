# SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1Status 

Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1Status` trap is generated when a temperature sensor exceeds a specified threshold. This trap indicates that the temperature reading from a sensor has reached a critical level, requiring immediate attention to prevent potential damage to equipment or disruption of services.

## Impact

* Equipment damage or failure due to overheating
* Disruption of services or system downtime
* Increased risk of data loss or corruption
* Potential fire hazard or physical damage to surrounding infrastructure

## Diagnosis

1. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
2. Verify the `spSensorValue` to determine the current temperature reading.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
4. Identify the affected sensor using the `spSensorIndex`, `spSensorName`, and `spSensorDescription` variables.
5. Review system logs and monitoring data to determine the cause of the temperature increase (e.g., cooling system failure, increased workload, etc.).

## Mitigation

1. Immediately investigate and address the root cause of the temperature increase.
2. Take corrective action to reduce the temperature reading (e.g., activate cooling systems, relocate equipment, etc.).
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and not reporting a false reading.
4. Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting mechanisms to detect temperature increases before they reach critical levels.
5. Perform a thorough system check to ensure that all equipment is functioning within normal operating parameters.
