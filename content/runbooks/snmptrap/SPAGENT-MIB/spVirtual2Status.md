# SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual2Status 

Virtual2 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a sample runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

This SNMP trap is generated when a virtual2 sensor reports a status change or exceeds a configured threshold. The trap provides information about the sensor's current status, value, and the level that was exceeded, which triggered the trap.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and its function in the network. However, it may indicate a potential issue with the sensor or the system it's monitoring, which could lead to downtime, data loss, or security breaches if left unaddressed.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Review the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
4. Compare the `spSensorValue` with the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand what triggered the trap.
5. Check the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional context about the sensor and its function.
6. Verify the sensor's configuration and settings to ensure they are correct and up-to-date.
7. Check the system logs for any related errors or issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Acknowledge the trap and notify the team responsible for the sensor and system.
2. Investigate the cause of the sensor status change or threshold exceedance.
3. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as adjusting the sensor configuration, replacing the sensor, or resolving any related system errors.
4. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and the system is stable.
5. Update the sensor's configuration and settings as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
6. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference.

Note: The specific mitigation steps may vary depending on the sensor, system, and network configuration. This runbook serves as a general guideline and should be tailored to your specific environment.
