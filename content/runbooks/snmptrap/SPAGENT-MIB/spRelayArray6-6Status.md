### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-6Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spRelayArray6-6Status` trap indicates that a sensor in the RelayArray6.6 has exceeded a configured threshold, triggering an alert. This trap provides information about the sensor that triggered the alert, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the threshold that was exceeded. However, in general, it may indicate a potential issue with the system or device being monitored, such as:

* Overheating or cooling issues
* Power supply problems
* Hardware failures or malfunctions
* Environmental issues (e.g. humidity, temperature)

Failing to respond to this trap may lead to further system degradation, downtime, or even data loss.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Determine the threshold that was exceeded using the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Review the sensor description using the `spSensorDescription` variable to understand the context of the sensor and the potential impact of the exceedance.
5. Check system logs and other monitoring tools for relevant information about the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the root cause of the sensor exceedance, using the diagnosis steps above.
2. Take immediate action to address the issue, such as:
	* Adjusting system settings or configurations to prevent further exceedances.
	* Replacing or repairing faulty hardware components.
	* Implementing additional monitoring or logging to track the issue.
3. Verify that the issue has been resolved by checking the sensor value and status.
4. Update system documentation and monitoring configurations as necessary to prevent similar issues in the future.
5. Perform a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement and implement changes to prevent similar issues from occurring.
