# SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual14Status 

Virtual14 sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spVirtual14Status` trap is generated when the virtual14 sensor detects an abnormal condition. This trap is sent to alert administrators of a potential issue with the sensor.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the condition that triggered the trap. Possible impacts include:

* System downtime or instability due to sensor failure
* Inaccurate monitoring or reporting due to sensor malfunction
* Potential security risks if the sensor is related to security monitoring

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Verify the `spSensorValue` variable to determine the current reading of the sensor.
4. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the threshold that was exceeded, causing the trap to be sent.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor and its function.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor malfunction or failure.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as replacing the sensor or adjusting the sensor's configuration.
3. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and the trap is no longer being generated.
4. Update any necessary documentation or monitoring configurations to reflect the changes made to the sensor.
5. Consider implementing additional monitoring or redundancy to prevent similar issues in the future.
