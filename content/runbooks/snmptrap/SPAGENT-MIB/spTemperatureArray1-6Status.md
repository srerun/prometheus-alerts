Temperature sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spTemperatureArray1-6Status`:

## Meaning

This trap is generated when a temperature sensor in the system has exceeded a critical threshold, indicating a potential overheating issue.

## Impact

* The system may become unstable or shut down if the temperature continues to rise.
* Data loss or corruption may occur due to system failure.
* Prolonged exposure to high temperatures can reduce the lifespan of system components.

## Diagnosis

* Check the value of `spSensorValue` to determine the current temperature reading.
* Verify the `spSensorStatus` to confirm that the sensor is reporting a critical condition.
* Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` value to determine the threshold that was exceeded.
* Use the `spSensorIndex` to identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap.
* Consult the `spSensorName` and `spSensorDescription` to understand the location and function of the affected sensor.

## Mitigation

* Immediately investigate the cause of the high temperature reading.
* Verify that cooling systems are functioning properly.
* Check for blockages or obstacles that may be impeding airflow.
* Take immediate action to reduce the temperature, such as shutting down non-essential systems or components.
* Consider scheduling maintenance to clean or replace failed cooling components.
* Monitor the temperature sensor closely to ensure the issue has been resolved.
