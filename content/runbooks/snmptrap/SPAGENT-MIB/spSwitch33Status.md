### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch33Status`:

## Meaning
The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch33Status` trap is a switch sensor trap that indicates an issue with a sensor on a switch. The trap is sent when a sensor reaches a certain threshold or level, and provides information about the sensor that triggered the trap.

## Impact
This trap may indicate a potential problem with the switch or its environment, such as overheating, power issues, or fan failure. If left unaddressed, this issue could lead to switch downtime, data loss, or even physical damage to the equipment.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sensor**: Check the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables to determine which sensor triggered the trap.
2. **Check the sensor status**: Examine the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. **Evaluate the sensor value**: Check the `spSensorValue` variable to see if the sensor reading is within a normal range.
4. **Determine the level exceeded**: Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to see what level was exceeded, causing the trap to be sent.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. **Investigate the sensor issue**: Perform a physical inspection of the switch and the sensor to identify the root cause of the issue.
2. **Take corrective action**: Based on the diagnosis, take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as replacing a faulty sensor, cleaning dust from a fan, or adjusting the switch's environment.
3. **Verify the sensor status**: After taking corrective action, verify that the sensor status has returned to normal and the trap is no longer being sent.
4. **Update maintenance records**: Update maintenance records to reflect the issue and the corrective action taken.
