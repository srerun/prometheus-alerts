  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue2Status trap is generated when an analogue sensor reports a status change or exceeds a predefined threshold. This trap is sent by the agent to the manager to notify of a potential issue that requires attention.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and the environment in which it is deployed. Possible impacts include:

* Disruption to critical systems or services due to analogue sensor malfunction or exceeding predefined thresholds
* Inaccurate or unreliable data from the analogue sensor, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or actions
* Safety risks or environmental hazards if the analogue sensor is monitoring critical systems or processes

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by examining the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current status of the sensor by examining the `spSensorStatus` variable.
3. Review the current value of the sensor by examining the `spSensorValue` variable.
4. Check if the sensor value has exceeded a predefined threshold by examining the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
5. Consult the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor and its significance.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor status change or threshold exceedance.
2. Take corrective action to resolve the issue, such as adjusting the sensor settings, replacing the sensor, or performing maintenance on the associated system or process.
3. Restart the sensor or associated system if necessary.
4. Verify that the sensor is operating within expected parameters and that the issue has been resolved.
5. Update any relevant documentation or procedures to prevent similar issues in the future.
