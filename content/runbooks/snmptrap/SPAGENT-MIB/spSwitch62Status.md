# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch62Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning
The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch62Status` trap is generated when a sensor on a switch reports a status change, indicating a potential issue with the switch's operation. This trap is sent when a sensor's value exceeds a set threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact
The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and threshold exceeded. Possible effects include:

* Reduced switch performance or reliability
* Increased risk of hardware failure
* Disruption to network operations
* Increased maintenance or repair costs

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific sensor reported in the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Compare the sensor value to the threshold that was exceeded, as reported in the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Consult the switch's documentation and sensor descriptions (available in `spSensorDescription`) to understand the implications of the sensor's value.
5. Check the switch's event logs and system monitoring tools for related errors or alerts.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the effects of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Verify the sensor reading and threshold exceeded to ensure the alert is valid.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue, such as:
	* Adjusting the sensor threshold or configuration
	* Cleaning or replacing the sensor or related hardware
	* Implementing measures to reduce the risk of hardware failure
3. Monitor the switch's performance and sensor readings to ensure the issue has been resolved.
4. Update the switch's configuration and monitoring systems to prevent similar alerts in the future.
5. Document the incident and resolution in the problem management system for future reference.
