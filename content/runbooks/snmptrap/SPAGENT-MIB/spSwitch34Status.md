# SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch34Status 

Switch sensor trap 


## Variables


  - spSensorStatus
  - spSensorValue
  - spSensorLevelExceeded
  - spSensorIndex
  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap:

## Meaning
The SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch34Status trap indicates that a switch sensor has exceeded a predetermined level, triggering an alert. This trap provides essential information about the sensor, including its current status, value, and the level that was exceeded.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that the switch sensor has detected an abnormal condition that may affect the normal operation of the switch or the network. If left unaddressed, this could lead to performance degradation, downtime, or even complete failure of the switch.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by looking at the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
3. Examine the `spSensorValue` variable to see the current reading of the sensor.
4. Review the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to understand the threshold that was exceeded.
5. Refer to the `spSensorDescription` variable for more information about the sensor and its role in the switch.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the predetermined level.
2. Take corrective action to address the root cause, such as adjusting the sensor settings, performing maintenance, or replacing the sensor if necessary.
3. Verify that the issue is resolved by checking the sensor readings and ensuring that the `spSensorStatus` variable indicates a normal or healthy state.
4. Update any relevant logs or documentation to reflect the resolution of the issue.
5. Consider adjusting the threshold levels or alarm settings to prevent future occurrences of this trap.
