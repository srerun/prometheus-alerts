  - spSensorName
  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spAnalogue5Status trap is generated when an analogue sensor exceeds a predetermined level. This trap indicates that a sensor has reported a value that is above or below a configured threshold, triggering an alert.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the specific sensor and the level that has been exceeded. If the sensor is critical to the operation of the system, this trap may indicate a potentially serious issue that requires immediate attention. Some possible impacts include:

* Equipment failure or malfunction
* Decreased system performance
* Potential safety hazards
* Increased risk of downtime or data loss

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Review the `spSensorValue` to determine the current value of the sensor.
3. Check the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to determine the level that was exceeded.
4. Consult the sensor documentation or configuration to determine the acceptable range for the sensor.
5. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of this trap, follow these steps:

1. Take immediate action to address the issue reported by the sensor.
2. Verify that the sensor is functioning correctly and that the reading is accurate.
3. Adjust the sensor configuration or threshold levels as necessary to prevent future occurrences.
4. Implement preventative measures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
5. Consider escalating the issue to a higher-level team or expert if necessary.
6. Document the incident and the steps taken to resolve it for future reference.
