  - spSensorDescription 

### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap description:

## Meaning

The SPAGENT-MIB::spVRMS5Status trap is generated when a VRMS (Voltage Regulator Module Sensor) sensor exceeds a predetermined level. This trap indicates a potential issue with the sensor or the system it is monitoring.

## Impact

If left unaddressed, this trap may indicate a potential issue with the system's power management or thermal management system, which could lead to system downtime, data loss, or even hardware damage.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific sensor that triggered the trap using the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Check the current value of the sensor using the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Compare the current value to the level that was exceeded (`spSensorLevelExceeded`) to determine the severity of the issue.
4. Review the `spSensorDescription` to understand the context and purpose of the sensor.
5. Verify the system's power management and thermal management systems are functioning correctly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the predetermined level (e.g., high temperature, voltage fluctuations, etc.).
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue (e.g., adjust cooling settings, clean dust from vents, replace faulty components, etc.).
3. Verify the sensor value has returned to a normal range.
4. If the issue persists, consider contacting the system manufacturer or a qualified technician for further assistance.
5. Update the sensor configuration or threshold levels as necessary to prevent future occurrences of this trap.
