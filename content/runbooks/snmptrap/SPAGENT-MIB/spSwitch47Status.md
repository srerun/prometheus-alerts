### Definitions 


**spSensorStatus** 
: The current integer status of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorValue** 
: The current integer value of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorLevelExceeded** 
: The integer level that was exceeded causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorIndex** 
: The integer index of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorName** 
: The name of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 

**spSensorDescription** 
: The description of the sensor causing this trap to be sent 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch47Status`:

## Meaning

The `SPAGENT-MIB::spSwitch47Status` trap is sent when a sensor on a switch reports a status change. This trap is triggered when a sensor exceeds a predetermined level, indicating a potential issue with the switch.

## Impact

The impact of this trap can vary depending on the specific sensor and level that was exceeded. Possible impacts include:

* Decreased switch performance
* Increased risk of switch failure
* Disruption to network services
* Potential data loss or corruption

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify the sensor that triggered the trap by checking the `spSensorIndex` and `spSensorName` variables.
2. Determine the current value of the sensor by checking the `spSensorValue` variable.
3. Compare the current value to the level that was exceeded, as indicated by the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable.
4. Check the `spSensorStatus` variable to determine the current status of the sensor.
5. Review the `spSensorDescription` variable for additional information about the sensor and the potential impact of the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate the cause of the sensor exceeding the predetermined level. This may involve checking environmental factors, such as temperature or humidity, or examining system logs for errors or warnings.
2. Take corrective action to address the underlying issue. This may involve adjusting the switch's configuration, replacing a faulty component, or performing maintenance tasks.
3. Monitor the sensor's value and status to ensure the issue is resolved and does not recur.
4. Update the `spSensorLevelExceeded` variable to reflect any changes to the predetermined level.
5. Consider implementing proactive monitoring and maintenance procedures to prevent similar issues from occurring in the future.
