# IF-MIB::linkUp 

A linkUp trap signifies that the SNMP entity, acting in an
agent role, has detected that the ifOperStatus object for
one of its communication links left the down state and
transitioned into some other state (but not into the
notPresent state).  This other state is indicated by the
included value of ifOperStatus. 


## Variables


  - ifIndex
  - ifAdminStatus
  - ifOperStatus 

### Definitions 


**ifIndex** 
: A unique value, greater than zero, for each interface.  It
is recommended that values are assigned contiguously
starting from 1.  The value for each interface sub-layer
must remain constant at least from one re-initialization of
the entity's network management system to the next re-
initialization. 

**ifAdminStatus** 
: The desired state of the interface.  The testing(3) state
indicates that no operational packets can be passed.  When a
managed system initializes, all interfaces start with
ifAdminStatus in the down(2) state.  As a result of either
explicit management action or per configuration information
retained by the managed system, ifAdminStatus is then
changed to either the up(1) or testing(3) states (or remains
in the down(2) state). 

**ifOperStatus** 
: The current operational state of the interface.  The
testing(3) state indicates that no operational packets can
be passed.  If ifAdminStatus is down(2) then ifOperStatus
should be down(2).  If ifAdminStatus is changed to up(1)
then ifOperStatus should change to up(1) if the interface is
ready to transmit and receive network traffic; it should
change to dormant(5) if the interface is waiting for
external actions (such as a serial line waiting for an
incoming connection); it should remain in the down(2) state
if and only if there is a fault that prevents it from going
to the up(1) state; it should remain in the notPresent(6)
state if the interface has missing (typically, hardware)
components. 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP Trap # IF-MIB::linkUp:

## Meaning

The linkUp trap indicates that an interface on a network device has transitioned from a down state to an operational state. This trap is generated when the ifOperStatus object for an interface changes from down to up or another operational state.

## Impact

The impact of this trap is minimal, as it indicates that an interface is now operational and ready to transmit and receive network traffic. However, it can be useful for network administrators to know when an interface has come online, as it may indicate a recovery from a previously failed state.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of a linkUp trap, the following steps can be taken:

1. Check the ifOperStatus value to determine the new operational state of the interface.
2. Verify the ifAdminStatus value to ensure that the interface is administratively enabled.
3. Check the interface configuration to ensure that it is properly configured.
4. Verify that there are no faults or errors on the interface that would prevent it from operating correctly.

Variables to check:

* ifIndex: The unique index of the interface that triggered the trap.
* ifAdminStatus: The desired state of the interface (up, down, or testing).
* ifOperStatus: The current operational state of the interface (up, down, testing, dormant, or notPresent).

## Mitigation

No specific mitigation is required for a linkUp trap, as it is a normal part of network operation. However, to ensure that the interface remains operational, network administrators should:

1. Continue to monitor the interface for any errors or faults.
2. Verify that the interface configuration is correct and up-to-date.
3. Perform regular maintenance and testing to ensure that the interface remains operational.

By following these steps, network administrators can ensure that the interface continues to operate correctly and provide reliable network connectivity.
