# DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptAbort 

This notification is generated whenever a running script
terminates with an smRunExitCode unequal to `noError'. 


## Variables


  - smRunExitCode
  - smRunEndTime
  - smRunError 

### Definitions 


**smRunExitCode** 
: The value of this object indicates the reason why a
script finished execution. The smRunExitCode code may have
one of the following values:
- `noError', which indicates that the script completed
successfully without errors;
- `halted', which indicates that the script was halted
by a request from an authorized manager;
- `lifeTimeExceeded', which indicates that the script
exited because a time limit was exceeded;
- `noResourcesLeft', which indicates that the script
exited because it ran out of resources (e.g. memory);
- `languageError', which indicates that the script exited
because of a language error (e.g. a syntax error in an
interpreted language);
- `runtimeError', which indicates that the script exited
due to a runtime error (e.g. a division by zero);
- `invalidArgument', which indicates that the script could
not be run because of invalid script arguments;
- `securityViolation', which indicates that the script
exited due to a security violation;
- `genericError', which indicates that the script exited
for an unspecified reason.
If the script has not yet begun running, or is currently
running, the value will be `noError'. 

**smRunEndTime** 
: The date and time when the execution terminated. The value
'0000000000000000'H is returned if the script has not
terminated yet. 

**smRunError** 
: This object contains a descriptive error message if the
script startup or execution raised an abnormal condition.
An implementation must store a descriptive error message
in this object if the script exits with the smRunExitCode
`genericError'. 


## Meaning

The DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptAbort notification is triggered when a running script terminates with an smRunExitCode that is not equal to 'noError'. This means that the script has completed execution with an error or abnormal condition.

## Impact

The impact of this notification can vary depending on the specific error code and the importance of the script to the system. However, some possible impacts include:

* Interrupted automation: If the script was performing critical automation tasks, its abrupt termination could lead to incomplete or inconsistent system configuration.
* Data loss or corruption: Depending on the script's function, its termination could result in incomplete or corrupted data, leading to system instability or errors.
* System instability: In extreme cases, the script's termination could cause system crashes or freezes, leading to downtime and impacting user productivity.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the smScriptAbort notification:

1. Check the smRunExitCode value to determine the reason for the script's termination.
2. Examine the smRunError object for a descriptive error message, especially if the smRunExitCode is 'genericError'.
3. Verify the script's execution history, including the smRunEndTime, to identify any patterns or trends in script failures.
4. Investigate system logs and event logs for any related errors or warnings that may indicate the underlying cause of the script's termination.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the effects of the smScriptAbort notification:

1. Implement script retry mechanisms to automatically restart the script if it terminates abnormally.
2. Configure script timeouts and execution limits to prevent resource exhaustion and minimize the impact of script failures.
3. Monitor script execution and detect anomalies using tools such as logging, auditing, and performance monitoring.
4. Develop and implement robust script error handling mechanisms to catch and handle runtime errors, language errors, and other script-related issues.
5. Regularly review and update scripts to ensure they are functioning as intended and are not contributing to system instability.
