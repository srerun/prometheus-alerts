# DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptException 

This notification can be used by scripts to notify other
management applications about script errors.
This notification is not automatically generated by the
Script MIB implementation. It is the responsibility of
the executing script or the runtime system to emit this
notification where it is appropriate to do so. 


## Variables


  - smRunError 

### Definitions 


**smRunError** 
: This object contains a descriptive error message if the
script startup or execution raised an abnormal condition.
An implementation must store a descriptive error message
in this object if the script exits with the smRunExitCode
`genericError'. 


Here is a runbook for the SNMP trap `DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptException`:

## Meaning
The `DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptException` trap is generated when a script encounters an error or exception during execution. This trap is not automatically generated by the Script MIB implementation and is the responsibility of the executing script or runtime system to emit.

## Impact
The impact of this trap is that script execution has failed, and an error message is available to provide more information about the failure. This can result in scripts not completing their intended tasks, leading to potential issues with network management and monitoring.

## Diagnosis
To diagnose the issue, check the `smRunError` object for a descriptive error message that indicates the reason for the script exception. This message should provide more information about the error that occurred during script execution.

## Mitigation
To mitigate the issue, investigate the error message in `smRunError` and take corrective action to resolve the underlying issue that caused the script exception. This may involve modifying the script, updating dependencies, or adjusting runtime parameters. Once the issue is resolved, re-run the script to ensure it completes successfully. Additionally, consider implementing automated error handling and logging mechanisms to quickly identify and respond to script exceptions in the future.
