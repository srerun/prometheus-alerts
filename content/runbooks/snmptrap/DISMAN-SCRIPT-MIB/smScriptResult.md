# DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptResult 

This notification can be used by scripts to notify other
management applications about results produced by the
script.
This notification is not automatically generated by the
Script MIB implementation. It is the responsibility of
the executing script to emit this notification where it
is appropriate to do so. 


## Variables


  - smRunResult 

### Definitions 


**smRunResult** 
: The result value produced by the running script. Note that
the result may change while the script is executing. 


## Meaning

The `DISMAN-SCRIPT-MIB::smScriptResult` SNMP trap is used to notify other management applications about the results produced by a script. This trap is not automatically generated by the Script MIB implementation and must be explicitly emitted by the executing script.

## Impact

The impact of this trap depends on the script that is emitting it. If the script is critical to the operation of a system or service, the failure to receive this trap could result in delayed or incomplete troubleshooting, leading to prolonged downtime or service degradation. Additionally, if the script is responsible for performing a crucial function, the absence of this trap could prevent administrators from being notified of its completion or success.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the cause of this trap, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Verify script execution**: Check the script's execution logs to ensure that it is running correctly and producing results.
2. **Check script configuration**: Review the script's configuration to ensure that it is properly set up to emit the `smScriptResult` trap.
3. **Check trap forwarding**: Verify that trap forwarding is configured correctly and that the trap is being forwarded to the intended management application.
4. **Review smRunResult variable**: Examine the value of the `smRunResult` variable to determine the result of the script's execution.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the impact of this trap, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Implement trap forwarding**: Ensure that trap forwarding is configured correctly to forward the `smScriptResult` trap to the intended management application.
2. **Configure script to emit trap**: Modify the script to explicitly emit the `smScriptResult` trap when it completes execution.
3. **Monitor script execution**: Closely monitor the script's execution and results to quickly identify any issues or errors.
4. **Implement redundancy**: Consider implementing redundancy in the script's execution or result processing to minimize the impact of any issues.
