## Meaning

The `WindowsServerCollectorError` alert is triggered when the `windows_exporter_collector_success` metric reports a value of 0, indicating that the Windows Server collector has failed to collect data successfully. This alert is critical, as it suggests that there is an issue with the collector that may impact the accuracy of monitoring and alerting for the Windows Server instances.

## Impact

The impact of this alert is that the Prometheus monitoring system may not receive accurate or up-to-date data from the Windows Server instances, leading to:

* Incomplete or inaccurate monitoring data
* Delayed or missed alerting for critical issues
* Increased mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) for incidents
* Decreased confidence in the monitoring system

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Windows Server collector logs for errors or exceptions related to the data collection process.
2. Verify that the collector is configured correctly and that the necessary dependencies are installed and running.
3. Check the network connectivity between the collector and the Prometheus server.
4. Investigate any recent changes to the collector configuration or the Windows Server instances that may have caused the issue.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Restart the Windows Server collector service to attempt to recover from the failure.
2. Review and update the collector configuration to ensure it is correct and complete.
3. Verify that the necessary dependencies are installed and running correctly.
4. Check for any vendor-specific documentation or knowledge base articles related to the collector and Windows Server instances.
5. Consider escalating the issue to the Windows Server team or a subject matter expert for further assistance.
