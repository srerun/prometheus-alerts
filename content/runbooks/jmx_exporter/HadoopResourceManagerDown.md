Here is a sample runbook for the HadoopResourceManagerDown alert:

## Meaning

The HadoopResourceManagerDown alert is triggered when the Hadoop ResourceManager service is unavailable for more than 5 minutes. The ResourceManager is a critical component of the Hadoop ecosystem, responsible for managing resource allocation and job scheduling. Downtime of this service can lead to significant disruptions to data processing and analysis workflows.

## Impact

The impact of this alert is high, as it can cause:

* Job scheduling and processing delays
* Data processing pipeline disruptions
* Inability to access and analyze data
* Potential data loss or corruption

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Hadoop ResourceManager logs for errors or exceptions
2. Verify that the ResourceManager process is running and healthy
3. Check the network connectivity and firewall rules to ensure that the ResourceManager is reachable
4. Review the Hadoop cluster's overall health and performance metrics
5. Check for any recent configuration changes or updates that may have caused the issue

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Restart the Hadoop ResourceManager service
2. Investigate and resolve any underlying issues causing the service to be unavailable
3. Verify that the ResourceManager is properly configured and running with the correct permissions and resources
4. Implement failover or high-availability mechanisms to ensure that the ResourceManager is always available
5. Perform a thorough root cause analysis to prevent similar issues in the future
