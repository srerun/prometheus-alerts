Here is a runbook for the HadoopHbaseRegionServerHeapLow alert:

## Meaning

The HadoopHbaseRegionServerHeapLow alert is triggered when the heap usage of an HBase Region Server exceeds 80% of the maximum heap size, indicating low available heap space. This alert is critical as it can lead to NodeManager restarts, Region Server failures, and eventual data loss.

## Impact

If this alert is not addressed promptly, it can have significant consequences on the Hadoop cluster's performance and stability. Some potential impacts include:

* NodeManager restarts, leading to temporary data unavailability
* Region Server failures, causing write failures and data inconsistencies
* Data loss due to Region Server crashes or inconsistent states
* Increased latency and decreased performance of Hadoop applications

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of this alert, follow these steps:

1. Check the HBase Region Server logs for any exceptions or errors related to memory issues.
2. Verify that the Region Server has sufficient memory allocated and that the maximum heap size is correctly configured.
3. Investigate if there are any memory-intensive operations or processes running on the NodeManager or Region Server.
4. Check the overall health and load of the Hadoop cluster, including disk usage, CPU utilization, and network traffic.

## Mitigation

To mitigate this alert, follow these steps:

1. Increase the maximum heap size for the Region Server by adjusting the `hbase.regionserver_java_heapsize` property in the `hbase-site.xml` file.
2. Restart the affected Region Server to apply the new heap size configuration.
3. Monitor the heap usage and adjust the heap size as needed to prevent future occurrences of this alert.
4. Consider implementing garbage collection tuning or heap profiling to optimize memory usage and prevent memory leaks.
5. Verify that the Hadoop cluster is properly sized and configured to handle the workload, and consider adding more nodes or resources if necessary.
