Here is a runbook for the HadoopYarnContainerAllocationFailures alert:

## Meaning

The HadoopYarnContainerAllocationFailures alert is triggered when the total number of YARN container allocation failures exceeds 10 over a 10-minute period. This indicates that there is a significant issue with YARN container allocation, which may impact the performance and reliability of Hadoop jobs.

## Impact

The impact of this alert can be significant, as it may lead to:

* Job failures or slowdowns due to container allocation failures
* Increased latency and decreased throughput for Hadoop jobs
* Potential data loss or corruption if containers are not allocated correctly
* Decreased overall cluster performance and availability

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the root cause of the HadoopYarnContainerAllocationFailures alert, follow these steps:

1. Check the YARN Resource Manager logs for errors or exceptions related to container allocation.
2. Verify that the YARN NodeManagers are functioning correctly and not experiencing any issues.
3. Check the Hadoop configuration files to ensure that the YARN configuration is correct and optimal.
4. Review the Hadoop job logs to identify any patterns or trends related to container allocation failures.
5. Use tools like the YARN UI or the Hadoop CLI to investigate the current state of the YARN cluster and identify any issues.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the HadoopYarnContainerAllocationFailures alert, follow these steps:

1. Restart the YARN Resource Manager and NodeManagers to ensure that they are running correctly.
2. Check and adjust the YARN configuration to ensure that it is optimal for the current workload.
3. Investigate and address any underlying issues that may be causing the container allocation failures, such as hardware or software issues on the NodeManagers.
4. Consider increasing the YARN container allocation timeout to give containers more time to start.
5. Implement a monitoring and alerting system to detect container allocation failures earlier and prevent them from impacting Hadoop jobs.
