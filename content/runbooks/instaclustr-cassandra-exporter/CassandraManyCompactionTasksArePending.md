Here is a runbook for the CassandraManyCompactionTasksArePending alert rule:

## Meaning

The CassandraManyCompactionTasksArePending alert is triggered when the number of pending compaction tasks in a Cassandra cluster exceeds 100. This indicates that the cluster is experiencing high latency and may be unable to keep up with write requests.

## Impact

If left unaddressed, this issue can lead to:

* Increased latency for read and write operations
* Decreased overall performance of the Cassandra cluster
* Potential data inconsistencies and errors
* Increased risk of cluster instability and downtime

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Cassandra cluster's current load and usage patterns to identify potential bottlenecks.
2. Review the Cassandra logs to identify any errors or issues related to compaction.
3. Verify that the node responsible for compaction is not experiencing high CPU or disk usage.
4. Check the pending compaction tasks queue to identify the Source, Keyspace, and Table with the highest number of pending compactions.
5. Verify that the Cassandra configuration is optimal for the current workload.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Identify and address any bottlenecks in the Cassandra cluster, such as high CPU or disk usage.
2. Adjust the Cassandra configuration to optimize performance, such as increasing the number of compaction threads or adjusting the compaction throughput.
3. Consider adding additional nodes to the cluster to distribute the load and improve performance.
4. Implement a more efficient data model or query patterns to reduce the load on the Cassandra cluster.
5. Monitor the Cassandra cluster closely to ensure the issue is resolved and does not reoccur.

Note: It's recommended to consult the Cassandra documentation and seek expert advice if you're unsure about the mitigation steps or their impact on your specific cluster configuration.
