Here is a runbook for the Prometheus alert rule:

## Meaning

The HaproxyHighHttp4xxErrorRateBackend alert is triggered when the rate of HTTP requests with status 4xx (client errors) exceeds 5% of the total HTTP requests on a specific backend server. This indicates that there may be an issue with the backend server or the requests being sent to it.

## Impact

* High error rates can lead to a poor user experience and reduced confidence in the application.
* Increased error rates can also lead to increased latency and decreased performance.
* Prolonged high error rates can also lead to resource wasting, as requests are being sent to a backend that is not able to process them correctly.

## Diagnosis

* Check the HAProxy logs to identify the specific 4xx error codes being returned and the URLsè¢«affected.
* Investigate the backend server logs to determine the root cause of the errors.
* Check for any recent changes to the backend server or application code that may be contributing to the errors.
* Verify that the backend server is properly configured and has sufficient resources to handle the incoming requests.
* Check for any issues with the network connectivity between the HAProxy server and the backend server.

## Mitigation

* Investigate and resolve the root cause of the 4xx errors on the backend server.
* Implement retry logic on the HAProxy server to retry failed requests.
* Consider implementing circuit breakers to prevent further requests from being sent to the backend server until the issue is resolved.
* Check for any opportunities to optimize the backend server or application code to reduce the error rate.
* Verify that the HAProxy server is properly configured to handle the incoming requests and that the backend server is properly configured to handle the traffic.

Note: The runbook is just a template and should be tailored to the specific environment and requirements of the organization.
