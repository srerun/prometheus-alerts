Here is the runbook for the HaproxyServerDown alert rule:

## Meaning

The HaproxyServerDown alert is triggered when a HAProxy server is down and not responding. This alert indicates that the HAProxy server is not reachable or not functioning correctly, which can impact the load balancing and proxying of traffic to backend servers.

## Impact

The impact of this alert can be severe, as it may cause:

* Loss of traffic routing and load balancing capabilities
* Inability to serve requests from clients
* Downtime for critical applications and services
* Potential security risks if the HAProxy server is not properly configured or patched

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the HAProxy server logs for any errors or warnings
2. Verify the HAProxy server process is running and listening on the expected port
3. Check the network connectivity to the HAProxy server
4. Verify the HAProxy server configuration is correct and up-to-date
5. Check for any recent changes or deployments that may have caused the issue

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Restart the HAProxy server process or service
2. Check and address any configuration issues or errors
3. Verify the HAProxy server is properly patched and up-to-date
4. Implement a backup or failover solution to ensure high availability
5. Notify the relevant teams and stakeholders of the issue and resolution
6. Consider implementing additional monitoring and alerting for HAProxy server metrics to prevent similar issues in the future.
