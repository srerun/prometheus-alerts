Here is a runbook for the ThanosRuleSenderIsFailingAlerts alert:

## Meaning

The ThanosRuleSenderIsFailingAlerts alert is triggered when Thanos Rule Sender is unable to send alerts to Alertmanager. This means that alerts generated by Thanos Rule are not being successfully sent to Alertmanager, which can lead to alert notifications not being sent to the intended recipients.

## Impact

The impact of this alert is that critical alerts may not be delivered to the teams that need to respond to them, leading to delays in response times and potential service disruptions. This can have severe consequences, especially in production environments where timely alert notifications are crucial.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Thanos Rule Sender logs for errors related to sending alerts to Alertmanager.
2. Verify that the Alertmanager API is reachable and functional.
3. Check the Thanos Rule configuration to ensure that it is correctly configured to send alerts to Alertmanager.
4. Verify that the network connectivity between Thanos Rule and Alertmanager is working correctly.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Restart the Thanos Rule Sender component to ensure that it is not stuck in a faulty state.
2. Check and update the Thanos Rule configuration to ensure that it is correct and functional.
3. Verify that the Alertmanager API is reachable and functional, and take corrective action if necessary.
4. Implement temporary workarounds, such as manual alert notification or alternative alerting mechanisms, until the issue is fully resolved.
5. Perform a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the issue and implement long-term fixes to prevent similar incidents in the future.
