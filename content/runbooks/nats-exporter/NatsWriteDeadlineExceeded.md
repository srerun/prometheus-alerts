Here is a runbook for the NatsWriteDeadlineExceeded alert rule:

## Meaning

The NatsWriteDeadlineExceeded alert is triggered when the write deadline for NATS (a messaging system) is exceeded. This means that messages are not being delivered within the expected timeframe, which can indicate issues with message delivery.

## Impact

The impact of this alert is that messages may not be delivered to their intended recipients in a timely manner. This can lead to issues with application performance, data consistency, and overall system reliability.

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the NATS server logs for any errors or warnings related to message delivery.
2. Verify that the NATS server is properly configured and that there are no connectivity issues.
3. Investigate any recent changes to the NATS configuration or application code that may be contributing to the issue.
4. Check the NATS metrics (e.g. gnatsd_varz_write_deadline) to determine the extent of the issue and identify any trends or patterns.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the NATS server configuration to ensure that the write deadline is set appropriately.
2. Investigate and address any underlying issues that may be contributing to the write deadline being exceeded (e.g. high latency, slow consumers, etc.).
3. Consider increasing the write deadline to give NATS more time to deliver messages.
4. Implement additional logging and monitoring to detect and alert on potential issues earlier.
5. Consider implementing retries or other fallback mechanisms to handle message delivery failures.
