Here is a runbook for the Prometheus alert rule:

## Meaning

This alert is triggered when there is an increase in the number of Prometheus template text expansion failures in a 3-minute window. This indicates that Prometheus is experiencing issues with expanding text in its templates, which can lead to errors in rendering dashboards, alerts, and other components that rely on template expansion.

## Impact

The impact of this alert is high, as it can lead to:

* Inaccurate or incomplete rendering of dashboards and alerts
* Increased latency or errors in Prometheus queries
* Difficulty in troubleshooting and debugging issues due to incomplete or incorrect data

## Diagnosis

To diagnose the issue, follow these steps:

1. Check the Prometheus logs for errors related to template text expansion.
2. Verify that the Prometheus server has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to handle the current load.
3. Check for any recent changes to templates or configuration files that may be causing the expansion failures.
4. Verify that the Prometheus version is up-to-date and compatible with the current environment.

## Mitigation

To mitigate the issue, follow these steps:

1. Investigate and resolve any resource issues (CPU, memory, disk space) on the Prometheus server.
2. Review and update any recent changes to templates or configuration files to ensure they are correct and compatible.
3. Restart the Prometheus server to clear any temporary issues.
4. Consider increasing the resources allocated to the Prometheus server or optimizing the template expansion process to improve performance.

Additional resources:

* Refer to the Prometheus documentation for more information on template text expansion and troubleshooting.
* Check the Prometheus community forums for similar issues and solutions.
* Review the Prometheus configuration files and templates to ensure they are correct and up-to-date.
